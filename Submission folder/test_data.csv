humanInterest,"johnny gilbert the voice of jeopardy keeps going at 92 . in this image provided by jeopardy productions inc. show announcer johnny gilbert appears on the set of jeopardy gilbert worked with host alex trebek for 37 years and was reluctant to continue after losing his admired colleague. but others with the show urged him to consider his role as a comforting touchstone for viewers who also were in mourning. in this 2014 image provided by jeopardy productions inc. show announcer johnny gilbert left and game show host alex trebek appear on the set of jeopardy gilbert worked with trebek for 37 years and was reluctant to continue after losing his admired colleague. but others with the show urged him to consider his role as a comforting touchstone for viewers who also were in mourning. los angeles ap johnny gilbert who decided to stick with jeopardy after alex trebek s death faced the wrenching question once again as production for next season neared. this time it would mean adjusting to the quiz show s yet to be named host as opposed to the succession of celebrities who have been filling in since trebek succumbed to pancreatic cancer last november. it s not easy for me because i worked with alex for 37 years and i never thought of anybody replacing him he said. nobody can do it like he did it you know. no one does it like gilbert either who at age 92 has decided he s not ready to call it quits on the show business career he began pursuing as a teenager. last year when he was reluctant to continue after losing his admired and longtime colleague others with the show urged gilbert to consider his role as a comforting touchstone for viewers who also were in mourning for trebek. if you just listen to the way johnny articulates each name each word he has a voice and even more importantly delivery unlike anyone else said mike richards the show s executive producer. without trebek the fact we can still rely on johnny is obviously very important to us as well. this is jeopardy is gilbert s richly booming introduction that opens each episode and belies his years. in turn he s acknowledged with thanks from the host and occasionally has been shown at an otherwise off camera stage perch. during the pandemic he s been taping his contributions remotely from the los angeles area home he shares with his wife sheree gilbert. they ve been together for several more years than his jeopardy stint the sort of marital and career longevity that s rare in hollywood. born near roanoke virginia and raised in the coastal city of newport news gilbert had something different in mind when he first dreamed of being an entertainer singing and his parents supported their only child s aspirations. i started taking voice lessons when i was still in high school got a job with a little band and traveled around in that area for a while he said. that was the beginning of it all. a winding path followed one with bumps and byways that included military service but gilbert was n t to be deterred. his advantages besides an impressive vocal range determination and a willingness to adapt to the work at hand. he was 18 when a newspaper want ad for a band singer sent him to jacksonville florida. turned out the act had already hit the road but instead of backtracking home he searched out a local talent manager. a club on the outskirts of town was looking for an emcee the manager told gilbert who had to admit he was unfamiliar with the term. master of ceremonies explained the manager who was undaunted when gilbert said he had no experience. he taught me how to introduce people on the stage and take them off the stage he recalled. he got the job and the opportunity to sing with the club band a gig that lasted for about six weeks and set the pattern for his fledgling career. it was america in the 1950s dotted with nightclubs and supper clubs and gilbert made the most of the opportunities. he started in the south and worked my way all across the country he said. the draft interrupted his career but not his stage work gilbert s talent was noticed and he was assigned to a army special services entertainment unit in germany. he was back on the nightclub circuit post service when an agent suggested to a delighted gilbert that he give television a try. he started in new york with game shows including music bingo then moved to la to host beat the odds and back again to new york as work dictated. among his many other tv credits are the joker s wild dinah shore s talk show dinah and the 25000 pyramid. then the syndicated version of former network series jeopardy beckoned in 1984 with both co creator merv griffin and trebek in his corner gilbert said. so 37 years ago merv hired me to be the announcer on a show called jeopardy for 13 weeks he said. gilbert expressed reservations about whether the sony pictures television series would bring him back when taping resumes in late july or early august for season 38. he s served as warm up host for the studio audience as well as the show s announcer. i m not as young as i used to be gilbert said. but there is a tradition of longevity in the field including the late don pardo of saturday night live. he was the show s voice for 38 seasons until his 2014 retirement at age 96. jeopardy producer richards who d stepped in as the show s first fill in host quickly brushed aside the notion that gilbert s tenure was in anyone s hands but his own. johnny will be the announcer of jeopardy as long as he would like to be the announcer of jeopardy richards said. i have told him that and it s just how he is humble. he s never taken the job for granted. the world s leading covid 19 vaccines may offer lasting protection that diminishes the need for frequent booster shots new

zimbabwe ap for pelagia bvukura who lives in a rural part of north central zimbabwe covid 19 had always been a city disease affecting those in the capital harare or other distant big towns. we only used to hear it was in harare or other towns or when city people died and we buried them here she said recently referring to the custom in zimbabwe where those who move to the city often are buried at their family s rural home. a new surge of the virus is finally penetrating africa s rural areas where most of the continent s people live spreading to areas that once had been viewed as safe havens from infections that hit cities particularly hard. with facilities in the countryside ill prepared to fight the coronavirus residents like bvukura worry that the next graves being dug could be for their neighbors or even themselves. her village of zvimba 110 kilometers 68 miles from harare has yet to record a major spike in infections but it sits in a province that is the current epicenter of the virus. like many here she wasn t wearing a mask and is yet to be vaccinated. africa has recorded over million cases and is experiencing the worst of a wave driven by more contagious and deadlier variants. the continent recorded a 39 increase in new cases in the week from june 14 20 according to the world health organization. with homesteads spaced far apart few visitors and rare public gatherings rural areas appeared so insulated that they drew some people from cities to escape both infection and economic hardship. it was a dangerous false sense of security. now a tragedy is unfolding said dr. johannes marisa president of the medical and dental private practitioners of zimbabwe association in harare. the delta variant that has devastated india has been detected in at least 14 african countries including congo mozambique namibia uganda south africa and zimbabwe and not just in the cities. we are starting to see an upward trend in the rural and marginalized areas said edward simiyu uganda country director of the charity group mercy corps in a statement earlier in june. in zimbabwe three of the four districts under strict lockdown and declared as epicenters of the outbreak are in the predominantly rural mashonaland west province which recorded over half of the 801 cases reported last weekend. other hot spots also are largely rural a first for this country. we are going to see a lot of deaths especially arising from rural areas. covid 19 is now coming from the rural areas said marisa attributing the spike to a high degree of complacency a lack of information and few vaccinations with urban areas prioritized. the virus can also spread at funerals when city dwellers return to visit rural relatives. i was at a funeral in a rural area recently and people were surprised to see me wearing a mask he said. rural areas are ill equipped to deal with the surge and urban health care facilities are under strain in treating an increasing number of people from the countryside. zimbabwe s major referral hospital parirenyatwa in harare is prioritizing beds for covid 19 patients. health facilities in rural areas are miserable so all those people are being referred to city hospitals marisa said. in mozambique s remote tete province a hotbed of infections where the delta variant was recorded president filipe nyusi expressed worry. we don t have many beds. we don t have many health staff in tete either nyusi said. because health care facilities in the countryside in places like uganda are more poorly staffed than those in urban areas a penetration of covid 19 infections in these rural and vulnerable regions is likely to be devastating risking more people slipping deeper into poverty further worsening social inequities divisions and conflict said simiyu of mercy corps. rural residents are finding it difficult to get vaccinated because of weak public health systems and vaccine distribution problems. only 1 of africa s billion people have been vaccinated according to the who and the africa centers for disease control. the zvimba rural district hospital only had just a small number of coronavirus vaccines reserved for second doses its staff said. but even after the vaccine becomes available the ability of health systems to absorb those doses and get them distributed particularly in rural communities is the next huge problem on the horizon said sean granville ross africa regional director for mercy corps in an interview with the associated press. there s a risk vaccines could sit spoiling in warehouses across african capitals if countries aren t ready to hit the ground running with mass vaccination campaigns including in the hardest to reach rural areas where health infrastructure is already weak as is trust in public health systems granville ross said. those in rural areas who are desperate for the vaccines including the elderly live far from hospitals and clinics. matrida tendayi who is 100 years old said she is too frail to walk to the nearest clinic in dema a rural area about 50 kilometers 30 miles from harare even if a vaccine was available.

education,"saratoga springs ny thursday afternoon saratoga springs high school celebrated 34 student athletes that had made the commitment to the next level of their athletic careers whether it be ncaa division i ii or iii or junior college. we know this has been a very challenging year for everyone. typically we would do two of these. we are very fortunate to have so many students participate in our athletic programs and gave themselves the opportunity to go on and continue to compete said saratoga athletic director nick mcpartland. unfortunately we could n t have a signing day in the fall and we have a lot of spring sports going on with a lot of spring athletes here who will be going to practice right after this. mcpartland understands the significance of being a collegiate athlete at all levels and wanted to give praise to all who made the commitment to the next step. mcpartland played division iii college baseball at cortland. i think it is important to acknowledge all of our seniors moving onto the next level. i looked this up and as recent as april of last year only seven percent of high school student athletes get to go on and compete at the next level said mcpartland. they are entering a group that is filled with elite level athletes and that s really exciting. of the 34 seniors celebrated thursday cristina demeo celebrated her decision to continue to run cross country and in track and field at harvard university. it was a really long process. i definitely wasn t able to say i want to go to harvard and go to harvard. it was many months and i wasn t sure where i was going to end up and didn t know what was going on said demeo. especially because i didn t have too many track times because of covid. it was a lot of emailing coaches talking to teammates visiting colleges so that when i did know where i was going to go it was such a relief. i was also looking at johns hopkins. it was a tough decision for me to choose between the two said demeo. harvard is division one and i was really looking for that athletic challenge because i want to keep improving all through college. along with demeo and the other seniors gymnast sierra kondo committed to the university of maryland while teammate sophia damiano signed to rhode island college. gymnast ava dallas signed to the university of new hampshire where she will be cheerleading. i always was competing with ava and we have always been great friends said kondo. it s great to see us all going off to great colleges but tough to see us splitting up. saratoga golf both boy s and girl s teams had commitments to college. will braxton signed to washington and lee university luke baringer committed to clarkson and mollie thomas signed to stonehill. i think it all starts going back to my teammates before. aj cavotta nolan crowley and the seniors when i was a freshman. we always had really good players and that helps foster an environment where you are encouraged to grow as players said braxton. when you are playing with better players than you you tend to pick up on things. you try to translate that to your own game and i think that is exactly what happened. saratoga seniors committed to schools like harvard clarkson the university of maryland boston university butler university manhattan college penn state the list could go on. the prestige of every school on the list is an indication of the community in saratoga springs according to mcpartland. one thing is apparent that i hear from people repeatedly here whether it is coaches administration teachers custodians everyone recognizes how great the kids are here. we have great kids which is a testament to our families here said mcpartland. our kids understand the balance between athletics and academics. they work really hard in the classroom and it carries over to the playing field. that s why these students specifically have given themselves a chance to compete at a higher level. they understand commitment dedication mental toughness and they can balance both the requirements of being an athlete after school and then bring it to the class room the next day. the full list of students who signed thursday can be found below. michael karpinski russell sage college baseball . christina demeo harvard university cross country and track and field . zoey goodness boston university lightweight

environmental,"our world is inundated with plastic and we are unable to recycle more than a fraction of the 36 million tons that the us produces every year. we know this much however the wrong way to deal with the problem is to give petrochemical companies a free pass on new jersey s environmental laws. that is essentially what a fast tracked bill will do and it s hard to know what is more perplexing the proposal itself or its author. assemblyman john mckeon d essex whose record on the environment is stellar says it is time for new jersey to open its mind to chemical recycling or advanced recycling as the industry calls it a method that uses intense heat pressure and solvents to break down old plastics to be remade into new plastics or fuel. theoretically this is the workaround for plastics that are not recyclable through the mechanical method which is how we deal with our coke bottles and tide jugs. mckeon s intentions as always are laudable we only recycle 8 percent of our plastic and we have to explore ways to reduce the waste that piles up in our landfills chokes our waterways and kills our wildlife. but volumes of data say chemical recycling is no solution at all and environmentalists suggest that mckeon s proposal gives tacit permission to the plastic industry to produce more plastic. the bill exempts chemical recycling facilities from our solid waste and recycling laws allowing them to operate outside county regulations on the disposal of plastic and as a spokesman for the american chemistry council crowed this is the first step in getting new jersey to a place where they re talking to companies and allowing these companies to come. new tech should be celebrated and hopefully this will evolve into a real solution someday. for now however there is little evidence that chemical recycling is viable. the global alliance for incinerator alternatives gaia a coalition of 800 environmental groups and ngos in 90 countries found that out of the 37 such facilities proposed in the us over the last 20 years only three are operational and none have produced new plastics on a commercial scale. the plant in ashley ind. which produces diesel and kerosene caught fire last month. moreover these facilities are dreadful polluters greenpeace has found that they produce three times the amount of greenhouse gases as plants that make virgin plastic. they are also the champions of false advertising. the epa hasn t even determined whether chemical recycling is recycling at all because most of them only produce fuel which is ultimately combusted in vehicles. as for profitability even plastics today a website for professionals in the trade pulverized the technology last month. it noted that advanced recycling promise to cure the plastic waste crisis are beginning to fall out of favor with investors because they haven t proven they can create any actual value and the ones that boast of recycling potential have little to show for it. for about 30 years we have been told by the plastics industry don t worry about your plastic consumption just put it in the blue bin and we ll take care of it says judith enck the former epa regional director who now runs an anti plastic advocacy group. now the industry is finally acknowledging that recycling doesn t work so they re want to shift to a chemical recycling method. i d rather it go to a landfill you d release far less carbon dioxide and not use massive amounts of solvents. but the best way to reduce plastic is by making less plastic period. as doug o malley of environment new jersey reminds us one third of all plastic enters our environment even before it reaches our waste stream. mckeon listened to detractors who testified last week but he still helped move a 5803 through the assembly environment committee. he later said that he would amend the bill to exclude plastics that are recycled through the mechanical method such as water bottles microwave trays milk jugs or plastics bearing no. 1 or 2 inside the ubiquitous triangle logo. and mckeon does not hide his skepticism. he said the industry s promises evoked those of big tobacco. he repeatedly said this is not a solution but maybe it s part of a solution. and in the end he and a chemistry council rep agreed that the technology is merely in the blackberry phase of its evolution. someday we will need technology to help us dig our way out of this crisis. but cooking plastic to make more fuel is not an answer. if mckeon wants a law with impact he can support the so called recycled content legislation a 4676 sponsored by his running mate assemblywoman mila jasey which establishes new requirements for plastic consumer materials and will incentivize the use of other material. it s getting a vote in the senate today. that s the kind of progress new jersey can use right now.

environmental,"australian energy storage specialist energy storage pty ltd has unveiled its next generation low cost long duration energy storage unit that the company says offers the same sort of performance as hydro but with the added advantage of being a fully mobile modular based system. energy storage ceo steve white commented there are three fundamental issues holding back the fully distributed power gen network. firstly having a net zero emission battery energy storage system that can be easily transported to remote locations where heavy industry and renewable energy farms are typically based secondly having an economic model a low enough cost entry point that makes sense to businesses of any size thirdly and most importantly in our eyes is not to be reliant on a rare earth mineral. rare earth mineral reliance is an issue for the industry at the moment as the lack of lithium for one will limit the amount of renewable energy that can be stored and usefully used. currently most of the storage systems of us and european utility companies make heavy use of lithium ion based technologies. for example in germany where 42 of the country s energy is now from renewable sources three facilities are now using recycled ev car batteries to provide their back up storage options. notwithstanding the energy and co2 emissions involved in mining lithium at a more basic level there is not enough lithium currently to go around. based on data from a leading mining publication for any one of the major western ev car manufacturers tesla mercedes vw to hit their own 2030 production numbers they would each take out over 150 of current global lithium annual production. that is before we overlay demands on the rare earth mineral from other sectors white said. more fundamentally lithium ion batteries were not conceived as a long duration heavy industry solution. they were designed as short term rechargeable batteries originally for portable electronic devices in the late 1980 s early 1990 s based on the research of john goodenough m stanley whittingham rachid yazami and koichi mizushima in the 1970s 1980s white reports. by contrast energy storage s next generation unit is based on salt or more specifically organic salts an earth abundant mineral. developed by an industry leading team out of melbourne s deakin and monash universities their technology uses organic salts and ionic liquids as phase change materials to stably capture and store thermal energy through a process known as state of matter change . stored energy can then be subsequently re released as energy by reversing that process. importantly the non corrosive nature of the ionic liquids means that standard casing materials can be used thereby helping minimise production costs. energy storage s technology has likewise been designed so that it can capture the energy for storage from waste heat renewable sources or even the grid in low peak periods and then released as zero emission electrical energy as and when required.

environmental,"corn stover is among the major feedstocks for biorefineries and can be converted to bioethanol. when corn stover contains moisture above certain levels it can clog conveyers and chutes during processing leading to operational problems and process stoppages. to eliminate moisture related stoppages at biorefineries scientists at los alamos national laboratory los alamos collaborated with bulk solids handling engineers at jenike johanson tyngsboro to develop smart transfer chutes. the biomass handling chutes are outfitted with acoustic moisture sensors for continuous realtime monitoring of corn stover moisture levels. the acoustic moisture sensors work by directing soundwaves through the corn stover as it is being processed. if moisture contents exceed those that are known to cause stoppages it sends a signal to a computer which engages a track change on the conveyor belt redirecting it to be further dried. the system improves the operational efficiency of biomass

unit at the okinawa institute of science and technology graduate university oist japan have reducing the cost of redox flow batteries redox flow batteries rfbs are a promising alternative to lithium ion batteries for storing large quantities of renewable energy see . a research group from the graduate school of engineering at tohoku university japan has developed an ion selective smart porous membrane that can respond to external stimuli for controlling permeation. the technology has potential applications in molecular separation and sensing applications. nanostructure properties such as pore size thickness and film density affect molecular selectivity and molecular permeability. surface properties also have a significant impact on molecular selectivity. therefore it is important to be able to control both the 3 d nanostructures and surface properties of ultrathin porous films. in our study we succeeded in developing responsive porous sio2 thin films with an extremely thin film thickness of 8 nm with a uniformly covered surface in a ph responsive silane coupling agent says yuya ishizaki a co author of the study published in langmuir. the responsive porous thin film can adjust the surface charge depending on the ph change in the solution resulting in selective ion permeation. to prepare the porous films with a controlled structure to nanometer scale accuracy the research group focused on polymer thin films containing silsesquioxanes which have unique cage structures. the polymer films were fabricated using the langmuir blodgett technique chosen because it provides molecular scale controllability in the film thickness. langmuir blodgett polymer nanosheets also make it possible to fabricate porous sio2 thin films with controlled nanostructures by simple ultraviolet uv light irradiation under ambient conditions. winterthur switzerland and ava biochem ag zug both switzerland have entered into an exclusive license agreement to commercialize ava biochem

lifestyle,"on may 23 2016 residents of the deupree house retirement home in cincinnati ohio were having dinner. patty ris 87 a new resident at the retirement home randomly selected an open seat at a table with several other people. the residents at patty s table were fully engaged in conversation in between bites of food when henry 96 turned to speak to patty. henry immediately realized that something was wrong. patty s skin color was no longer pink. her mouth was puffed up and her lips were out henry explained later. patty s eyes were wide. she was beginning to panic because she was choking. no one else at the table had realized that patty was in distress. henry had never performed the heimlich maneuver on a choking victim but there was no time to wait for anyone else. in an instant henry turned patty in her chair so that he could perform the heimlich maneuver. the heimlich maneuver was introduced in 1974 and quickly spread throughout the world. according to one estimate the technique has saved the lives of more than 100000 in the united states alone. it is mandatory training for most emergency medical personnel policemen firemen etc. some people you may have heard of whose lives were saved by the heimlich maneuver include marlene dietrich goldie hawn walter matthau jack lemmon carrie fisher cher simon cowell former new york mayor edward koch and former president of the united states ronald reagan. in 2014 clint eastwood reportedly used the heimlich maneuver to save the life of a golf tournament director. staff from the retirement home rushed to the table but saw that henry a retired doctor seemed to have the situation under control. henry was far from the feeble old man that you might expect a 96 year old person to be. his routine included swimming and other exercises. i did it three times henry said and a piece of meat with a bone in it came flying out of her mouth and she was alright. patty s color quickly returned to normal. henry became something of a celebrity following his use of the heimlich maneuver. i sort of felt wonderful about it henry said just having saved that girl. i knew it was working all over the world. i just felt satisfaction. in a thank you note to henry patty wrote god put me in that seat next to you i was gone i couldn t breathe at all. henry told reporters i didn t know i really could do it until the other day the day he saved patty s life. you see henry who had never used the technique to save a life created the heimlich maneuver. his name was dr. henry heimlich.

education,"edinburgh university could be among institutions involved in the trial . the scottish government has given the green light to a plan for universities to use on campus accommodation for international students if they can demonstrate safety measures in place would match those being used at quarantine hotels. however before it is allowed a pilot scheme involving two unnamed universities must take place to make sure it is feasible. at the moment anyone arriving in the uk from red list countries has to quarantine at government approved hotels at a cost of 1750 a hugely expensive sum for many students. more than 100000 international students are due to come to the uk in september from red list countries according to universities uk international uuki . as well as concerns over cost it is unclear if there is enough hotel space to accommodate them all. in april it was revealed some institutions were in talks with the scottish government about participating in a hotel quarantine pilot in july to help deal with the influx of foreign students due to start courses in september. the scottish government would not confirm if they still plan to run the pilot in july or if it would be pushed back but in a statement a spokesperson said the scottish government has been exploring with universities how student accommodation could be used in place of hotels for managed isolation. guidance is currently being drafted for a pilot scheme to assess how this would work in practice with two universities expressing an interest in taking part. ministers agreed to permit student accommodation to be used for managed isolation for international students and students returning to scotland following an educational exchange if universities can provide the necessary assurances that the accommodation meets equivalent public health protection assurances as hotels. if the scheme is still to happen next month international students due to arrive for pre sessional education in july could be in the frame to be used. universities scotland which represents scotland s 19 higher education institutions said international students would begin arriving from mid august to september and many were awaiting clarity on quarantine requirements. a spokesperson said the situation with international travel is changing constantly as we have seen again over the course of this week. our top concern right now is to ensure that the uk and scottish governments are planning with some urgency to ensure there is sufficient capacity for arrivals from red list countries for the purposes of higher education in august and september. the start of the academic year just like the summer tourist season has been visible on the horizon for some time. we must be ready to safely manage these arrivals in everyone s interests. universities are ready to support this but they need clarity from both governments on this issue. asked about the quarantine pilot they added a number of universities in scotland expressed interest in being part of a pilot to run managed isolation for international student arrivals from red list countries as a means to offer covid safe entry whilst also offering more robust wellbeing and support measures for what is likely to be a younger demographic than the majority of people using the hotel isolation. institutions are still in discussion with the scottish government on the detail of how this might be achieved in a way that gives an equivalent management of the risk of transmission to the use of hotels. the government refused to confirm which universities will take part but aberdeen stirling st andrews and glasgow universities are known to have expressed interest. heriot watt university in edinburgh said it had withdrawn from the scheme because the institution did not have the right facilities. a spokesperson said heriot watt university had expressed an early interest in the scottish government led pilot. however after careful assessment it became clear the university would be unable to meet the requirements necessary to fit halls of residence style accommodation into hotel style guidelines and has now withdrawn from the scheme. a spokesperson for st andrews university said the university of st andrews is working with the scottish government and clinicians to find a sensible approach to providing managed isolation at the university in an environment where students can be supported by the full range of university services. the university has demonstrated a solid track record of managing quarantine since the pandemic started in march 2020 and remains hopeful that this will be supported by the scottish government to allow managed isolation to be provided within our university residences. a spokesperson for aberdeen university said we continue with the rest of the sector to engage closely with the scottish government to ensure that students and staff coming to aberdeen from out of the uk are supported through any self isolation requirements that will be in place. stirling and glasgow universities didn t respond to request for comment. vivienne stern director of uuki described the scottish pilot plan as good news but said nothing similar was on the cards for english universities at the moment. she said some individual universities may be able to meet hotel quarantine standards so now the discussions are between the department of health and social care dhsc and the sector about whether that would be possible to take it forward whether that will form a pilot i don t know. i think there are going to be questions about how the dhsc in the end feels about travel distance from port of entry to point of quarantine. so it s not resolved there s no discussion of a pilot it s simply that we re in that information sharing phase.'

retail and services the growth will be about commerce coming to you rather than you coming to commerce. a lot of retail and certain aspects of food will move to delivery. ritual puts busy professionals into a fast lane by simply adding convenience into the everyday coffee lunch and dinner transactions. the team behind ritual isn t serving the 1 focusing on the mass and middle class market instead. ritual solves for the needs of professionals on their lunch or coffee break people who watch their budgets and have limited time to waste. people make their lunch purchases in the radius of where they are. so we ve taken on a hyper local approach to how we figure out supply. ray reddy ritual ceo . we know that 50 of the population transacts with qsr two to three times a week said reddy. it s a massive industry and it s serving regular people. there have been delivery companies for over a decade in the so while delivery has been around for a decade it s a tiny portion of the market and the amazon model hasn t been figured out yet. our model is quite simple we thought a lot about how to build something that s useful for people. toronto alone has about to 2 billion dollars in qsr spend. people make their lunch purchases in the radius of where they are. so we ve taken on a hyper local approach to how we figure out supply. ritual focuses on corporate users and some of those corporate users are getting pretty creative with the platform. for example aol uses ritual as part of its micro rewards program offering people more frequent and smaller perks lunches on fridays or lunches for the entire team. offering convenience and access to local gourmet lunch and coffee can be quite compelling. we have many companies doing interesting things with our platform to complement delivery or catering take the pain out of the expense reports. it s easy to see what s been billed to the company s account and saves everyone time and adds a ton of convenience said reddy. the ritual team has grown over the last few months from less than ten people and to well over 20. we ve gone from one neighbourhood in toronto to seven. right now we are working with property managers. we re taking over the financial district tower by tower. just two to three months ago we had seen healthy growth from 80 to over 300 restaurants and cafes on the platform. ritual s bet on indie coffee and small business . for merchants and small business owners competing with the likes of starbucks is the new reality. since they re not tech companies they can t possibly keep up with the cycles of change in technology. in the world of mobile that competes on convenience and customer experience many small businesses are drawn to the value apps like ritual can offer. beyond the cost of building our own app the main reason we ve partnered with ritual is that no one wants ten different restaurant apps on their phone says mustafa yusuf owner and ceo of big smoke burger. with ritual all the local favourites are available in one stop making the customers lives simpler. it flows seamlessly with our customers daily habits from a morning coffee to lunch on a tight timeline making it perform for both us and the customer allowing all of us to benefit from having multiple choices to dine drink and snack in one convenient location. as a result a lot of people use ritual regularly and we benefit from that. ritual claims success at figuring out the model to manage the supply and demand of local businesses at scale. the main reason we ve partnered with ritual is that no one wants ten different restaurant apps on their phone. mustafa yusuf big smoke burger . merchants on ritual are usually very successful because we have ways to predict that success said reddy. we take our concentrated demand of corporate spend and drive it to a certain percentage of merchants in a target zone. some of our best merchants will do well over 100000 this year just because of their partnership with ritual. since we take a percentage of sales we drive we re motivated to create a situation where it s free for merchants to be on ritual and it costs them nothing unless we drive incremental sales. we invest in great relationships with our restaurants and cafe partners. we have recently hired an account manager for our merchant partners to work with them closely on how to take

unrest,"since the tragic death of george floyd america has witnessed one tragedy after another as the media has fueled one of the most divisive periods in history since the civil war s brother against brother. lost in the ashes of this unrest and unfound claims of systematic racism and the decadent anti forgiving cancel culture of woke ism are memories of many of our nation s greatest unifiers. no historical event has left a deeper imprint on america s memory than the civil war of 1861. by 1865 a war torn north and south began the slow and painful process of reconciliation. hidden deep within the archives during unification are some of america s greatest moments. these events emphasize the appreciation of black americans for the heroes who once wore the blue and gray. lost in our national culture is much of the sincere empathy for the contributions of black americans during and after the war. untold and forgotten events that helped win the war and reunify brother with brother remind us that many of these moral crusades were some of our greatest victories. united states colored troops aka usct embodied frederick douglass belief that he who would be free must himself strike the blow. a total of 179000 black patriots many of whom were former slaves volunteered to fight for the union in the civil war. over 37000 gave their lives in a war they knew they had to win. with every battle they fought the usct proved that they could out duel any foe. usct units displayed courage under fire and won glory on the fields of battle at port hudson in louisiana fort wagner in south carolina new market heights spotsylvania and wilson s wharf in virginia. records indicate that over 10 of the union army was comprised of black americans. we need more people with enough patriotism to live up to the constitution. frederick douglass the usct were a watershed in american history and one of the first major strides toward equal civil rights. abolitionist frederick douglass said that when the usct was formed it transformed the civil war from a conflict for restoration of the union into a moral crusade to end american slavery. besides the patriotic usct many other black americans contributed to the critical rebuilding of our broken union. most of these were former slaves who remained in the south following the civil war during reconstruction. despite economic hardship segregation and denial of equal rights they were grateful for every soldier of every color who fought and died to deliver them their freedom. one of the casualties of war are the graves of so many unknown heroes. after the american civil war a battered america faced the task of burying and honoring 800000 union and confederate soldiers. shortly after the confederacy surrendered in 1865 groups of former slaves gathered in charleston south carolina to pay tribute to and memorialize the unknown fallen union soldiers. charleston s washington race track had been transformed by the confederate army into a prison. prisoners were confined there without medical supplies shelter or sanitation with little food to eat. over 250 died of war wounds and diseases. they were dumped into a massive grave site behind the grandstand. it is well that war is so terrible or we should grow too fond of it. robert e. lee to black americans in charleston the former washington race track and union graveyard was a painful reminder of the despicable and inhumane treatment that had been inflicted upon those that liberated them. many of them had been forced to help bury these heroes in this communal grave. as these grateful citizens watched the confederates leave charleston they would return to the race track and pray for the soldiers. black workmen came back to the gravesite and reburied the union soldiers with dignity. to protect the graves and preserve their memory they built a fence around the cemetery with these words inscribed at the entrance martyrs of the race course. if a man hasn t discovered something that he will die for he isn t fit to live. martin luther king . according to reports in the charleston courier on may 1 1865 a crowd of over 10000 former slaves white abolitionists and missionaries staged a parade around the race track. over 3000 black children laid flowers upon the graves and sang gospel music. the famed black american 54th regiment and other usct troops performed a special march around the gravesite of these fallen union soldiers. black ministers led people in prayer and recited bible verses in their memory. the first national commemoration of decoration day renamed memorial day after ww ii to honor all fallen soldiers was held in arlington national cemetery on may 30 1868. people came from states around the to pay tribute to both union and confederate soldiers. some 5000 people decorated the graves of over 20000 civil war soldiers from both sides of the mason dixon line. cities in the north and south from macon georgia to richmond virginia to carbondale illinois claim they held the first decoration day. yet the actual founding of this holiday and most official accounts of why it was a special day for the freed slaves of charleston south carolina have been erased from public memory and have been removed from common core public school textbooks. abraham lincoln said we cannot escape our history. in 450 bc greek author herodotus wrote the first history book to warn future greeks about the tragic greco persian wars so future cultures would not repeat them. the only good is knowledge and the only evil is ignorance herodotus our public schools and the liberal media are depriving generations of americans of knowledge of salient events and moral tributes by groups and individuals that helped bring americans together at critical times in our history. these were special people that did special things that built bridges over past cataclysms. they refused to dwell on the past and helped build a better future for americans. we can t predict the future but we can avoid repeating our past mistakes if we know what we did wrong and what we did right. if we do not revisit our failures and our achievements we are doomed to fail again. those who have no knowledge of their past lack the tools needed for a better future. when former slaves honored their union liberators on the first decoration day it was the beginning of the healing for america after the civil war. these former slaves wished to mourn those who died for their freedom and forgave those who had oppressed them. america needed healing and these former slaves paved the way for all america. maybe we can do the same again on decoration day. i refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality. i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. dr. martin luther king "" "

crime,"phoenix ap the arizona attorney general is suing former seven term santa cruz county sheriff tony estrada and a former top aide to recover nearly 200000 they say the pair allowed to be illegally paid out of county funds to compensate sheriff s deputies for extra duties. but the attorney representing estrada and his former second in command called the allegations that stem from an arizona auditor general s report absurd and said top county officials knew of the practice for years and approved of it. it s like alice in wonderland which is kind of like nogales can be sometimes attorney douglas clark jr. told the associated press on thursday. the lawsuit filed in maricopa county superior court on wednesday seeks not only the payments that estrada and his top deputy allowed between june 2013 and september 2018 but triple damages under provisions of the arizona racketeering act. that could put them on the hook for nearly 600000 in restitution and penalties. the civil lawsuit relies on an april 29 report from the arizona auditor general that documented how estrada and his former top aide allowed deputies who were given extra duties like acting as a training officers to claim an hour of overtime for each shift they worked as compensation. the county board of supervisors did not allow estrada to provide the extra pay. although estrada confirmed to auditors that the practice began in 2000 the auditor general s review only covered five years of payments that totaled 196842. that money went to 77 different employees who together claimed more than 7200 hours of unworked overtime pay. estrada 77 served as sheriff of the border county for 30 years and retired late last year. he is known for his unapologetically liberal views in a state where sheriffs are often known for being politically conservative. in a brief interview thursday estrada said he was disappointed that the attorney general had sued but referred questions to his attorney. in an interview after the auditor s report was released estrada denied personally profiting from the practice and confirmed that he believed county officials didn t adequately fund law enforcement. the only one that profited out of it was public safety in santa cruz county estrada said. clark estrada s attorney said much the same thursday and that they could prove it. everybody knew about it and approved it clark said. and we have affidavits from the prior county manager to that effect. and there s no question that they did nothing below board they profited in no way individually. in the lawsuit the attorney general outlined a plan estrada orchestrated to allow deputies who were assigned as field training officers communications training officers corporals or shift leaders to claim an hour of overtime for each day they worked. the overtime was paid at times the normal hourly rate. in addition after the board of supervisors refused to authorize filling a lieutenant s position in 2016 estrada promoted a sergeant anyway and had them falsify time cards to collect extra pay. one lieutenant who served from february 2016 until his march 2018 retirement collected 14840 in unearned overtime pay. also named in the lawsuit is former capt. ruben fuentes who the lawsuit and auditor s report say was aware of the scheme. the auditor s report says a county manager told estrada in an october 2018 email that she learned the sheriff s office had been paying employees for unworked overtime that the practice wasn t allowed and to stop it immediately. the next day the top aide emailed estrada and other top leaders in the sheriff s office saying the sheriff is asking that we proceed as usual until he gives us other instructions according to the report. auditors said the county manager stopped the practice the next week. clark said despite what the lawsuit and auditor s report say current county manager jennifer st. john was aware of the practice. she knew about it clark said. she knew what was going on. that s absurd for her to say she didn t know what was going on. st. john did not immediately return a call seeking comment thursday afternoon. but the auditor general report said she was unaware of the extra pay practice and said two former county managers also said they were unaware of paying for unworked overtime one in an affidavit. lastly all 3 board of supervisors members as of february 2019 with their combined 30 years of county service reported to us that they either thought it was fraud or they were not aware of these overtime payments and the sheriff had never mentioned them the report said. a spokesman for arizona attorney general mark brnovich ryan anderson would not comment beyond what was in the lawsuit filing or say if any criminal charges were being considered against estrada or fuentes. associated press reporter jacques billeaud contributed.

breeds like the mudi a hungarian herding dog. kim seiter an agility trainer from oak ridge new jersey was at westminster for the first time with her dog komoly hoping to showcase the super cool really fun smart hard working breed. another contestant stella is part of a breed better known for snoring than athleticism she s a bulldog. but owner lucy hayes realized early on that she had a wild puppy that loved to play and now the 3 year old competes in agility and dock diving. i thought i was doing something to keep my dog busy but to me now the message that bulldogs can be active and healthy and is a big one said hayes of dayton ohio. she does extra conditioning with stella consulted with vets to make sure she was physically ok for the sport and is careful to keep her from overheating. veterinarian dr. maria badamo says all dogs can do agility if they do n t have developmental problems that prevent it and are kept in peak condition. i think it helps to keep dogs mentally physically

religion,"forest rights in india reflect correlative duties of tribal communities to preserve wildlife and it is in consonance to the fundamental duty under article 51 a g . a recent news report published by down to earth revealed the killing of over 200 wild animals in west bengal s junglemahal forest area by the local tribal population. the animals were killed as part of the centuries old annual hunting season observed by adivasis known as shikar utsav. there are two opposing views on the issue while one part supports it as a traditional customary ritual of indigenous people others oppose it in the name of wildlife conservation and animal rights. hunting has been a core part of human civilisation since the beginning. it became deeply embedded in human cultures along with agriculture fishing and gathering. some of the oldest cave paintings also depict scenes of hunting. many of the saharan rock art dating back to the bubalus period between 10000 bce and 7000 bce showcases several scenes of hunting and the relationship between humans and animals. moving ahead to the middle ages and the colonial period hunting has been depicted in many paintings and later in photographs. in india mughal paintings often depicted kings going out for hunting tours. the akbarnama has several scenes of akbar s hunting expeditions often assisted by his pet cheetahs. the same was followed by the british colonial masters of india. on a single day on december 25 1911 during the visit of king george v 39 tigers 18 rhinoceroses four bears and a leopard were killed in the terai region of the indo nepal border. george yule a british civil servant killed more than 400 tigers and geoffrey nightingale shot more than 300. between 1875 and 1925 at least 50000 tigers were slain in india according to estimates based on home department records. post independence the genuine need to protect india s wildlife was realised and in 1952 the indian wildlife board was constituted to centralise all rules and regulations relating to wildlife conservation in the country. one of the most landmark actions by the board was to accord the status of sanctuary national park to the all erstwhile game reserves in the country. in 1972 the stringent wild life protection act 1972 was a major step towards wildlife conservation. the act classified animals into different schedules based on the need for protection and hunting of these species was outlawed and penalties were prescribed in case of violations. this legislation played a major role in protecting india s rich wildlife. but on the other hand it rendered traditional hunting rights practised by many tribal communities illegal. the traditional right to hunt wild animals has been recognised by many legal systems across the globe. australian courts and legislatures have recognised the native title rights of torres strait islanders and aboriginal australians and have included the drowning of dugongs harpooning of turtles and even killing the turtles with strong blows to their heads. some of these rights also include breaking the necks of mutton bird chicks. cruel as it appears these customary hunting activities have been exempted from australia s animal care and protection act of 2001. however when we deal with the indian laws we have a different scenario. section 3 l of the scheduled tribes other traditional forest dwellers recognition of forest rights act 2006 or forest rights act fra excludes the traditional right of hunting or trapping or extracting a part of the body of any species of wild animal. but the community right to hunt is prevalent in many tribal and traditional forest dwelling communities. the traditional community rights associated with hunting are not immune from the criticism that they draw from conservation perspectives. for several tribal and other traditional forest dwelling communities reliance on a property based framework instead of a regulatory one is significant to enforce their community rights to wildlife and forest resources. these communities cannot extend the horizon of their environmental prerogatives in a regulatory frame to attain the wide multitude of human based and human caused reasons for wildlife mortality. many of these communities cannot even inertly rely on the legislative framework to protect and preserve their rights and interests in the regulatory frame. a wide range of existing literature on aboriginal forest and wildlife management will attest to this notion. the native conservation servitude associated with wildlife in and around the protected areas draws its genesis way back to the long history of their existence. the native right to such natural wildlife capital is ingrained in their way of life. the fra 2006 during its adoption has ascertained these facets quite boldly and it was not pacifically accepted by conservationists too. however with changing times laws and their interpretations have also opined and opened the corridors of balancing arrangements where the conflicting native rights of such communities and concerns of forest and wildlife conservationists do collide to finally come to a settlement. however the question remains whether such customary practices associated with wildlife capital can be exercised without any affiliation of law. some of the foreign judgments are of great relevance in this context. in the united states v winans 198 us. 371 1905 the tribal access to fishing sites was under question. native americans in the us have several treaty rights. there is an enduring principle that treaties are reservations of rights by native americans and not grant of rights by the us federal government 198 us. in this case the court found that there existed an easement to the traditional fishing sites and such easement operates as a servitude on the ceded property and private property owners may not interfere with the indian use and enjoyment of it 198 us. subsequently in the united states another landmark judgment on treaty rights held that the federal government may regulate treaty fishing rights in the interest of conservation so long as the said regulation is reasonable and necessary as well as non discriminatory against native americans puyallup tribe v washington department of fish and game 391. furthermore many such judgments such as sohappy v smith washington v washington state commercial passenger fishing vessel association etc contributed to the evolution of treaty rights in the united states due to interpretation by the courts. in india we are yet to witness such magnitude of judicial interpretations in a matter pertaining to customary rights to hunt wildlife. but one cannot rule out the role of tribal trusteeship in wildlife even its existence and relevance in the deep remote dense forests of india. this is because they are an essential attribute of sovereignty as it deals with such species to which several such indigenous communities have property and usufructuary rights. from the face of our national legislation on wildlife protection and forest conservation it is quite clear that such communities may not assert this trusteeship over wildlife capital. but in a way they retain certain significant aspects of their trusteeship towards forests and wildlife that are well matched and compatible with their rights recognised by the law such as the fra . however one question looms is the state s public trusteeship over such wildlife and forest resources subservient to such customary tribal rights which although not codified exists since time immemorial . from several judgments on forest rights in india we can establish that forest rights reflect correlative duties of such communities to preserve wildlife and it is in consonance to the fundamental duty under article 51 a g . we have instances to show how some tribes have given up their customary hunting rights for the conservation of wildlife and environment at large. the angami tribe of nagaland gave up their hunting rights which was connected to their right to livelihood. the nyishi tribe in arunachal pradesh who once hunted hornbills and used their beaks to make headgears are today successfully running a hornbill conservation movement. it is a matter of time when we truly realise the essence of intra and inter generational equity from its core and realise the value of wild species even over our folklore and avaricious desires. chiradeep basak is an assistant professor of law at national law university and judicial academy assam. he specialises in

sport,"field this weekend roaring at dodger home runs booing a member of the home team josh reddick for past transgressions committed in another league that they must have felt like road games for the arizona diamondbacks. the dodgers came to town for the weekend filled the stands with their fans and collected their door prize a three game sweep of the diamondbacks wrapped up with a messy finish to a 9 8 win sunday afternoon. a soft spot in the schedule fed the dodgers three last place teams the pirates rangers and diamondbacks in a two week stretch and they fattened up winning 10 of 12 games during the two weeks eight of nine against the trio of cellar dwellers. against the diamondbacks the dodgers outscored them 21 11 in the three games. six of those runs came in the eighth inning sunday afternoon as edwin uceta fresh off the plane from triple a and victor gonzalez struggled to close out the weekend. but the dodgers held the diamondbacks scoreless in 20 of the first 21 innings and never trailed in the series. on the bright side for the freefalling diamondbacks they were able to sell nearly 87000 tickets this weekend to watch the worst team in baseball. the diamondbacks have now lost a franchise record 17 consecutive games and a remarkable 40 of their past 45 including 23 in a row on the road. there were times sunday when it looked as if the dodgers could score 20 runs if they wanted and there was a time in that eighth inning when it looked as if they might need to. they settled for nine getting a three run home run from albert pujols a three hit three rbi game from pollock multi hit games from chris taylor justin turner austin barnes and pujols as well and even a double from starting pitcher tony gonsolin. for pujols the home run was the 673rd of his career 11th of the season sixth with the dodgers and continuing validation of his assertion upon signing with the dodgers that he still has some gasoline in the tank. the dodgers signed pujols to hit left handed pitching something that has been problematic for their lineup and he has done just that. through sunday he is 16 for 43 .372 with five home runs and 13 rbi off lefties since the angels released him. for gonsolin the double was a callback to his college days as an outfielder. more importantly he looked more like the pitcher he was for the dodgers last season. in his third start since returning from a shoulder injury gonsolin retired nine of the first 10 batters he faced needing just 30 pitches to get through three scoreless innings. he reached the 30 pitch mark in the first inning of each of his previous two starts. gonsolin ran into trouble in the fourth allowed a run and was pulled by dodgers manager dave roberts after just 46 pitches. reddick got his revenge for the boos driving in three runs with singles off dodgers relievers david price and uceta. the eighth inning uprising earned fans a taco bell promotion briefly revived retaliatory chants of beat la and forced roberts to use kenley jansen to close out a game the dodgers led 9 1 in the sixth inning. and that is not a good feeling for them. the dodgers came to town for the weekend filled the stands with their fans and

economy,"shopping the meat counter can be intimidating if you don t know what to look for. what s the best cut to use for a given recipe how do you know you re getting the freshest product generally speaking the shorter the distance between the butcher and the farm the better says corrie cook narration director for indianapolis based goose the market and smoking goose. shopping local shouldn t be the only consideration when buying meat but it s often a good sign of a personal relationship between butcher and farmer which can mean a better quality product not to mention the ripple benefits of supporting your local economy local jobs and the local environment. here are some other items to consider when you re shopping for meat . most butchers won t let customers smell products before they buy due to health code concerns meaning the best indicator of freshness is usually the appearance of the meat. with fresh beef for example customers should look for a fairly bright red color with white or yellow marbling. if you re in a shop that ages beef the cut is going to be darker the marbling is more defined and the exterior of the meat may look a little dried out adds goose the market s head butcher kevin fruth. fresh pork should be light pink with white fat the color will be darker with heritage breeds. heritage pork many times will have skin still attached don t be worried if there s a hair or two left on it fruth points out. it will cook off and it won t hurt you and the skin should add beautiful crackling to the exterior of your roast or chop. if there s any question customers can always ask about delivery schedules to find out exactly when the meat arrived and where it came from. a meat counter that offers a variety of products may turn you on to a new favorite item. and it may even add value to your overall shopping experience by offering time saving prepared items or less expensive alternatives to your traditional purchases. sausages cured meats smoked meats stuffed roasts and marinated meats all fall under the umbrella of old school full service butchery cook attests. a shop that knows how to do more than just cut meat can indicate a well trained crew who likes to cook and eat just as much as you do. customers can learn something by asking about cooking tips or substitutions for the cuts and products they usually buy. in any butcher shop worth its salt the old adage applies you get what you pay for. if you re just looking for basic hamburger meat that you plan to season up for a spaghetti sauce or chili quality may not be as much of an issue as with a good steak or tenderloin that allows the natural flavor and texture of the meat to really shine through. there s a reason that small farm products aren t typically sold at big box grocery stores and often carry a higher price than their factory farmed counterparts appearing instead at gourmet markets and specialty meat shops like smoking goose. the quality and the effort absolutely show in what we offer fruth mentions. the way the animals are processed in large facilities absolutely affects the texture flavor and color of the meat and you ll be able to tell that when you cook it and eat it at home. when it comes to sausages and charcuterie especially look for producers who don t cut corners cook suggests. curing without compound nitrates working by hand in small batches smoking over real wood and other traditional techniques take more time more patience and more expertise but there s no substitute for the exceptional flavor and texture they produce. butchers work with meat all day every day and they know their stuff. think of them as a resource that can help guide you to the best purchases. questions i recommend asking usually address alternatives to different cuts portioning and packaging and special orders fruth says. if you don t see what you want there s no harm in seeing if your butcher can order it in or cut something differently to accommodate your request.

identity to match the sex they were assigned at birth. the legislation proposes five new offences related to conversion therapy including causing a minor to undergo conversion therapy removing a minor from canada to undergo conversion therapy abroad causing a person to undergo conversion therapy against their will profiting from providing conversion therapy or advertising an offer to provide conversion therapy. genuis has claimed the legislation would actually discriminate against lgbtq people by restricting access to professional or spiritual support to limit their sexual behaviour or de transition. local experts in lgbtq youth at macewan university have argued that genuis claims are unfounded noting that bill c 6 would not restrict any appropriate and professional conversations between a counsellor and client of any age. last october genuis abstained on a second reading vote on bill c 6 arguing the legislation could criminalize private conversations between a parent or mentor and gay teenagers. genuis has however reiterated his firm conviction that conversion therapy should be banned. genuis casts lone vote against papal apology . wide backlash followed genuis lone vote in parliament blocking unanimous consent to request a papal apology for the catholic church s role in residential schools. the motion put forward last tuesday by ndp mp charlie angus who represents timmins james bay was in reaction to the discovery of 215 unmarked graves of children at the former kamloops residential school and was a reiteration of the same motion tabled in may 2018. genuis went against the entirety of parliament by failing to give the motion his support. while asking for the papal apology for the establishment operations and abuses of the residential schools which was included within the calls to action with the truth and reconciliation report the motion also called on the catholic church to live up to its moral obligations and the spirit of the indian residential school settlement agreement and resume best efforts to raise the full amount of the agreed upon funding as well as asking the catholic church to hand over all relevant documentation regarding residential schools. due to the lone vote against no debate was allowed on the motion but angus quickly requested a call to order to squeeze in a reaction. i just want to confirm that it s the conservative party of canada that is giving the catholic church a free pass angus said before he was cut off. last wednesday s proceedings mirrored that of a 2018 vote by genuis where he was the lone mp in the country blocking the same request. in response genuis told postmedia his vote was based on the need to separate church and state. he maintains that everyone who was involved in the residential school system bears responsibility and welcomes the pope to canada to take further steps a visit during which the mp expects an official apology would be issued. parliament publicly dictating to the church doesn t effectively advance reconciliation. the government needs to take responsibility for what it s done and its obligations in terms of the trc calls of action and other actors have every reason to do that as well and they need to do that themselves genuis stated. the majority of those on social media were not impressed by the mp s move with some local constituents saying genuis is not properly representing them in ottawa and that they re ashamed. i accept that my votes in parliament will never be able to respect 100 per cent of what everybody thinks because residents have different points of view genuis said adding those critical on twitter are less likely to provide feedback in town halls local round table discussions one on one phone calls and mailed out surveys. i think i ve been very responsive to what people have been saying on a variety of issues he added. local politicians also spoke out against the mp. as elected officials we need to put aside our personal beliefs and do what is best for our community and in your case the country. this vote hurts your community and country. i cannot support your decision tweeted strathcona county s ward 8 coun. genuis will hold a virtual town hall on thursday june 17 and will host several subsequent town halls throughout the summer season where constituents are welcome to provide feedback and ask questions. to rsvp contact the constituency office by emailing or calling 780 467 4944. more information about town hall dates is available on garnett genuis facebook and twitter pages.

health,"i have early onset alzheimer s and i m tired of hiding it. i was diagnosed at 53 after two years of telling my primary care provider and my loved ones that something was wrong with my memory. eventually i had a meltdown in my office after taking four hours to write what should have been a 15 minute document and i placed an emergency call to my primary care physician s office. i met with a doctor who really listened the next morning. ironically much of my 32 year career in human services involved advocating for others but i hadn t been assertive for myself until that pivotal day. everyone had an excuse for why i was forgetting things. my job was stressful. my learning disability left me without a back up system. menopause had caused anxiety and depression which can interfere with memory. some conversations aren t important enough to remember. but i knew something was truly wrong. after months of blood tests brain scans and four specialists i finally got confirmation to what i knew all along. each doctor told me that the next one would confirm a diagnosis. it wasn t until i asked the fourth one outright that i was finally told. it felt like no one wanted to be the bearer of bad news and kept passing the buck. despite the hard news it was also a relief because i had a name. by that time i had already had to leave my career had my daughter take over most of my finances and had to start adapting my daily activities. the day i got diagnosed i scheduled an appointment to complete my will with a lawyer and to revise my advanced directive with my primary care physician. i let my family my best friend and only a couple other people know. otherwise i kept it a secret like it was something i should be ashamed of. i was afraid others including my small circle of the informed would question every decision i made. i would need to take care of the reactions of others. alzheimer s is a condition that leads to a series of losses and humiliations and by telling others i would have to face them publicly as well as cope privately. and with the pandemic it was easy to hide. now the pandemic is coming to a close and my deficits are mounting. i m hoping that going public in this way will lead to a greater understanding and commitment to support individuals with my condition. so far alzheimer s has taken many things from me. i never know whether i will remember a conversation or a visit with another person. i contend that this is the key cause of my anxiety. it can be rather nerve wracking when you don t know whether you will remember something regardless of its import. i often don t trust myself. i need much more alone time yet caregivers are told to keep me engaged. i feel a lack of purpose despite having activities to do. i have a hard time standing up for myself or what i know to be right for fear i will automatically be dismissed. i have word recall problems. sometimes i ramble on. sometimes i have a hard time making my point. i can no longer correct my vision with glasses because the problem is that my brain no longer sees clearly not just my eyes. the constant mildly blurred vision causes near daily headaches. i have difficulty doing paperwork that used to be easy and something i helped others with. i fear all of my judgments for the last several years will be questioned despite how mild my condition was and that i made all serious decisions for myself and others with a team. the latest humiliation is having some difficulty with basic problem solving and completing a task i have been doing since i was about 10 years old. i keep wondering what will go next how bad will it get and how quickly will that bad come. the alzheimer s association hotline has been kind and supportive. family and my best friend have been kind and supportive. but of course no one can answer those fundamental questions. no one knows the answer. the final indignity is that death with dignity is not available to me. so this letter also serves as a plea to the medical and legislative community. by the time i am within six months of my physical death my dementia will have progressed so far that i won t be considered able to make my own decisions. i will be too young to have a guardian appointed for me. i won t be able to avail myself of the options i could have if this was cancer or congestive heart failure. and while i can make a rational thoughtful decision of how and when i want my life to end i am denied the option of making a plan with professionals and family to be enacted when i cross a certain line of incapacity. imagine not knowing who your children are. of needing full time personal care and attendance. of wandering out lost into the vermont cold when no one is noticing. that last one really scares me. i think many would find these outcomes especially when only in their 50s as undignified and unreasonable to endure. i have cared for people through their last moments of life and i felt proud to support their decisions whether to maximize the length of life or to choose not to. i just wish that i could get that same support but alzheimer s is robbing me of that as well. my rights as a citizen of vermont are another loss of self for me to endure with this disease. i don t need sympathy. i am hoping that since i am known to quite a few as a helping professional in this community that my words will be listened to. i am grateful for the career i have had. i am grateful for my family. this letter will be letting many friends know for the first time about my condition. please let it be a catalyst for people to truly listen to one another when they say something is wrong. i am working towards being matter of fact about my condition with myself and others. so to those that know me i hope this gives them the opportunity to process and accept without needing to do it in front of me for their sake and """

weather,"hundreds of lakes in europe are losing oxygen . 30 2012 file photo kim bertini looks over some of the 15000 dead fish that washed up near her backyard on lake madeline in galveston texas. bertini said she and her husband chris noticed dying fish on a saturday and woke up the following morning to the dead floating fish. the galveston county daily news reported that experts blame low levels of dissolved oxygen for the fish kill in lake madeline. oxygen levels have dropped in hundreds of lakes in the united states and europe over the last 40 years a new study has found. oxygen levels have dropped in hundreds of lakes in the united states and europe over the last four decades a new study found. and the authors said declining oxygen could lead to increased fish kills algal blooms and methane emissions. researchers examined the temperature and dissolved oxygen the amount of oxygen in the water in nearly 400 lakes and found that declines were widespread. their study published wednesday in the journal nature found dissolved oxygen fell in surface waters of these lakes and in deep waters. the authors said their findings suggest that warming temperatures and decreased water clarity from human activity are causing the oxygen decline. oxygen is one of the best indicators of ecosystem health and changes in this study reflect a pronounced human footprint said co author craig e. williamson a biology professor at miami university in ohio. that footprint includes warming caused by climate change and decreased water clarity caused in part by runoff from sewage fertilizer cars and power plants. dissolved oxygen losses in earth s water systems have been reported before. a 2017 study of oxygen levels in the world s oceans showed a 2 decline since 1960. but less was known about lakes which lost two to nine times as much oxygen as oceans the new study s authors said. prior to this study other researchers had reported on oxygen declines in individual lakes over a long period of time. but none of have looked at as many lakes around the world said samuel b. fey a reed college biology professor who studies lakes and was not involved in this study. i think one of the really interesting findings here is that the authors were able to show that there s this pretty pronounced decline in dissolved oxygen concentrations in both the surface and deep parts of the lake fey said. the deep water drop in oxygen levels is critical for aquatic organisms that are more sensitive to temperature increases such as cold water fish. during summer months they depend on cooler temperatures found deeper in the water but if deep waters are low on oxygen these organisms can t survive. those are the conditions that sometimes lead to fish kills in water bodies said study co author kevin c. rose a professor of biology at rensselaer polytechnic institute. it really means that a lot of habitats for cold water fish could become inhospitable. other organisms rose said are more tolerant of warmer temperatures found at the surface level and can get enough oxygen by remaining near the surface where water meets air. about a quarter of the lakes examined actually showed increasing oxygen in surface waters which rose says is a bad sign because it s likely attributable to increased algal blooms sudden growth of blue green algae. in these lakes he said dissolved oxygen was very low in deep waters and was unlivable for many species. and the sediment in such oxygen starved lakes tends to give off methane a potent greenhouse gas research shows. lakes examined in the new study were in the or europe except for one in japan and a few in new zealand. the authors said there was insufficient data to include other parts of the world. rose said lakes outside the study area probably are experiencing drops in dissolved oxygen too. the reason he said is that warmer temperatures from climate change reduce the ability of oxygen to dissolve in water its solubility. coronavirus infections are down across europe but a virus variant may slow progress. meanwhile child campers can forego masks in the latest change brightening the summer outlook for americans eager to shed virus restrictions. see how and where these deadly storms strike and explore how their frequency and severity has increased over time. 30 2012 file photo kim bertini looks over some of the 15000 dead fish that washed up near her backyard on lake madeline in galveston texas. bertini said she and her husband chris noticed dying fish on a saturday and woke up the following morning to the dead floating fish. the galveston county daily news reported that experts blame low levels of dissolved oxygen for the fish kill in lake madeline. oxygen levels have dropped in hundreds of lakes in the united states and europe over the last 40 years a new study has found.""

politics,"republicans in arizona are still pushing the myth that president joe biden stole the 2020 election a falsehood that ultimately culminated in the jan. 6 violent attack on the capitol. the falsehood lives on in the review of about million ballots in maricopa county arizona launched in april. a report on its findings is expected later this summer. election experts both democrats and republicans have questioned the legality of the partisan led ballot review and say it lacks transparency. they re concerned that it could feed a new wave of misinformation about the election. and yet republican politicians from more than a dozen other states have visited the coliseum in phoenix where the ballot inspection is underway a sign that they may pursue similar ballot reviews elsewhere. tim miller former political director for republican voters against trump called the audit a circus in an essay for the bulwark. he warned that the audit promoted by qanon supporters could conclude it was trump who won and that the former president and his maga media echo chamber will once again stoke the flames of insurrection. local journalists in arizona have been following the twists and turns of the audits. here are some of the answers they ve found for common questions along with analysis from election experts. what s the status of the arizona ballot inspection . despite judges rejecting lawsuits alleging wrongdoing and post election audits in maricopa county finding no abnormalities republican state senators wanted their own audit. state senate president karen fann with encouragement from trump and his lawyer rudy giuliani sought a review of the ballots and sued maricopa to gain access. to conduct it the state senate republicans hired a team that included a little known group called cyber ninjas headed by doug logan who promoted stop the steal conspiracy theories about the election. the ballot inspection started in late april and is largely complete with a few exceptions including braille ballots said ken bennett a former gop secretary of state and a spokesperson for the senate republicans. the review is now in the phase of a forensic paper evaluation which includes examining the authenticity of the ballots. the workers are looking at whether the ballots were folded as would be expected with mail in ballots or not folded as would be expected for ballots cast in person bennett said. but election experts say there is nothing suspicious about the presence or absence of folds. jennifer morrell a former local election official and national expert on post election audits was tapped by the arizona secretary of state to observe the ballot inspection. she concluded it was rife with problems including the assumption among auditors that folded ballots suggest fraud. i almost had to laugh in my experience voters will fold ballots every which way no matter where they vote or what the ballot instructs them to do she wrote in the washington post. chalk it up to privacy concerns or individual quirks but no experienced elections official would call that suspicious. it s wrong to assume that all election day ballots would not have a fold said tammy patrick a former maricopa elections official. provisional ballots are folded and placed into an envelope for authentication adjudication said patrick. folds mean nothing about the validity of a ballot. the arizona republic reported that a tech contractor hired by the state senate made copies of election data and is reviewing it in a secure lab in montana. bennett told politifact that the findings by the tech firm will be incorporated into the final report about the ballot review. what s with claims that the audit showed trump won . similar falsehoods with the same number have circulated for months. officials involved with the audit say these claims are wrong. there s been no such finding released bennett said. bennett told politifact that the report will be finished in late july or august. organizers have repeatedly said that they aren t releasing partial results. when they finish their review organizers will take a few weeks to write a report and hand it over to the state senate. it would then be up to the state senate about whether to forward any findings to the state attorney general. claims that a large number of ballots are missing are all speculation and unfounded bennett said. but the organizers are looking into what he called minor discrepancies. fann wrote in a may 12 letter to maricopa officials that there were discrepancies between logs created by maricopa that state the number of ballots in a batch and the actual number of ballots in a batch. but maricopa s board of supervisors four of whose five members are republican said those differences reflected damaged ballots that were sent to be duplicated and are tracked separately. megan gilbertson a spokesperson for the maricopa county elections department said the state senate didn t subpoena all logs that pertain to duplicated ballots. are there really complaints that some ballots are too neat . when i was there one of the auditors showed me an example of a ballot that was flagged as suspicious because every single oval was filled out perfectly without a single stray mark something that would be easy for a machine to accomplish but is almost impossible to do by hand kerik wrote in an article for newsmax. bennett said that the auditors are examining the ballots and markings. but again they haven t released any findings. election officials typically find variation in how voters make their marks on ballots including how completely they fill out the oval patrick said. some voters do take great care in marking their ballot as the instructions tell them to. meanwhile other voters are messier. morrell the expert on audits wrote in the washington post that she overheard an arizona audit volunteer talking about an alleged cheeto finger that stained a ballot. the allegation that a neatly filled out ballot is suspicious isn t unique to arizona. a poll manager in georgia a republican activist raised concerns about what she said were pristine ballots that had a different feel in fulton county. are other states going to embark on similar audits . politicians election officials and activists from about 17 other states including wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania have visited the coliseum according to bennett. the wisconsin delegation s trip was funded by voices and votes a group headed by bobb and chanel rion of oan the conservative outlet that has raised money for arizona s ballot review according to reporting from the milwaukee journal sentinel a politifact partner. it s uncertain how many other states are interested in similar ballot inspections. a group in georgia is pursuing a review of ballots in fulton county. the arizona republic reported that the conspiracy theory qanon is hovering in the background of the audit. a group in georgia is pursuing a review of ballots in fulton county. what s the connection to qanon . the arizona republic reported that the conspiracy theory qanon is hovering in the background of the audit. qanon followers have coalesced around a theory that the audit itself would trigger the major event long prophesied by q the arizona republic wrote. some follow every development of the audit on channels devoted to it on telegram a messaging application that has grown in popularity as facebook and twitter have culled users who post disinformation. q is an anonymous internet persona who claims to be a government insider with information on a deep state plot to work against trump. the conspiracy theory claims public figures like hillary clinton tom hanks and oprah winfrey are satan worshipping cannibalistic pedophiles who will be brought to justice one day. q s posts on a fringe internet forum have been the basis for the qanon conspiracy theory. the audit is the great awakening in how we ve been manipulated by those that want to control us the user just stan wrote june 2 on the arizona audit watch chat channel the arizona republic reported. qanon was also linked to the conspiracy theory about secret watermarked ballots. auditors did initially scan ballots with uv lights to see if there were watermarks but soon dropped that process. is biden s justice department taking any action . attorney general merrick garland made a reference to the arizona ballot inspection without naming the state in a june 11 speech on voting rights. some jurisdictions based on disinformation have utilized abnormal post election audit methodologies that may put the integrity of the voting process at risk and undermine public confidence in our democracy garland said. in may the justice department sent a letter to arizona s fann suggesting that the audit may violate the federal civil rights act especially in regard to voter intimidation. the letter prompted republicans to stop plans to go door to door to speak to voters in maricopa. garland announced he will soon double his staff in the civil rights enforcement division. lawyers are scrutinizing new election laws and post election audits garland said.

their stealthy abilities like the macaques who pickpocket travellers. some are important cultural or religious symbols like macaques. these animals also play key roles in their ecosystems pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds. although there are around 500 primate species in the world three quarters of them are facing population declines. because most primates live near the equator many are especially vulnerable to climate change. in a recent study my colleagues and i looked at what would happen to primate species around the world if global temperatures rose 2 degree c the upper limit

stretches around the equator from central and south america to africa and asia. but the majority of them are found in four different countries brazil madagascar indonesia and the democratic republic of the congo so many people have not had direct contact with them. still we may know them from films like the capuchin in pirates of the caribbean or may have heard of their stealthy abilities like the macaques who pickpocket travellers. some are important cultural or religious symbols like macaques. these animals also play key roles in their ecosystems pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds.

give conservation scientists important information on how climate change will influence primate populations in the future. new heat extremes . we already know that global warming will not be uniform across the planet. the arctic is warming faster than places closer to the equator for example. but for animals already living in hot places a slight increase in temperature could readily move them past a threshold and outside their comfort zone. the threshold temperatures in our study represent the hottest temperature that each primate species would have faced in pre industrial times. we then compared future average temperatures to this baseline. yet we found that under that scenario per cent of all the habitats where primate species live will be hotter than their threshold temperatures. for some species such as the patas monkey and the senegal bushbaby in africa this could mean long periods throughout the year where temperatures surpass 33 degree c. like humans primates overheat and become dehydrated with continued physical activity in extremely hot weather. in a warmer future they would have to adjust resting and staying in the shade during the hottest times of the day. this could mean foraging less or not mating which could limit overall food intake and change reproductive cycles. those species living in the brazilian amazon along the north coast of venezuela the centre of equatorial africa the african east coast and the northwest coast of madagascar will be most affected. those that are already endangered have populations occupying less than 12000 square kilometres and are facing significant temperature increases such as annual averages consistently above 27 c are at greatest risk of extinction with the compounding effects of climate change. for instance the celebes crested macaque the famous monkey selfie primate and the siau island tarsier are both critically endangered in small habitats while currently experiencing year round temperatures above their historic thresholds. our analysis also showed that climate change has already pushed eight per cent of primate species habits past their thresholds. this means some populations may be facing additional stress due to hotter temperatures and changing their behaviour to compensate. these species all have declining populations and have been categorized as close to extinction the new heat extremes could be partially to blame. human impact . it s easy to assume that warmer global temperatures would lead to an increase in the habitat primates favour by stretching it north and south and upwards on mountain slopes. but because of human population growth infrastructure and agriculture some species may not be able to move to these newly suitable areas. many primates prefer to avoid us and our roads cities and fields block them from getting there. in some cases there is no habitat for them to move to because it has been logged mined or degraded in some other way. habitat loss hunting the illegal pet trade and disease have already cut back primate populations. climate change will likely increase the duration and intensity of extreme weather events such as cyclones and droughts putting more pressure on the survival of already struggling species. conservation is key . our model did not include conservation issues such as habitat loss that primates are already facing. yet the areas with the most primate species predicted to surpass temperature thresholds have also been identified as suitable for the expansion of palm oil plantations. the combination of the two would only further reduce these species access to suitable habitat and put them at greater risk of extinction. nature reserves have been helpful in maintaining populations of wild animals. however the borders of wildlife reserves and protected areas are usually fixed and not easy to move. future temperature increases could alter the habitat within a protected area so that it is no longer suitable for the primate species living there now. considering the rapid rate of climate change future primate conservation should include predicted temperature changes in combination with the other issues that primates face. for example wildlife reserve boundaries could be chosen based on future climatically suitable habitat for a species. primates are amazing and fascinating animals that deserve a home on this planet alongside us.""

arts,"before the covid 19 health and economic crisis the nation s homeless population was already on the rise. now more than a year after the last official population count many of those working with homeless communities believe numbers are much higher. i would estimate we ve got about 8000 people who are sleeping out on the streets or in some of the shelters said shirley raines whose non profit serves the homeless community on skid row in downtown los angeles. by the last official count in early 2020 more than 4500 individuals resided in the roughly 50 block area. there are more women on the street than before raines said noting that a women s shelter had closed down amid the pandemic. the resources had dried up. existing data does not reflect the devastating impact of the pandemic. but if raines s estimate is accurate that s a skid row surge of more than 40 percent since covid 19 hit. for the past six years raines and her organization beauty 2 the streetz have been a mainstay on skid row providing food clothing hair and makeup services and most recently health and hygiene items to thousands of people. rain or shine she sets up shop weekly at the corner of 5th and townes to serve those she calls kings and queens. her goal to make the homeless feel human whether that means a haircut a facial a hearty meal or a hug. it s not so much just giving them makeup or doing their hair it s also the physical touch raines said. people need physical touch. that s what was hard when the pandemic hit. we had to stop doing hair we had to stop doing barber services. and that might be the nicest touch they ve had all day. raines who for years struggled with financial insecurity grief and loss after the death of her first son says she knows how it feels to be labeled. the world looked at me and thought probably the same thing they think about the homeless when they pass them by she said. you never know what anyone s going through you know . in 1990 raines then 2 year old son demetrius was staying with raines grandmother when he accidentally ingested medication and was hospitalized. i blamed myself for not having stability. if only i d had my own backyard. if only i d had my stuff together raines said. the woman who had given me so much in life was also the cause of my greatest loss. and how do you rationalize that as a 20 year old soon after raines also faced the loss of her grandmother and then her son s biological father to cancer. i lived a very unhappy life. i could n t keep anything together she said. i m telling you anything that i could do to get myself out of this planet this world i tried it. and i m still here you know and i m like what is this about . after struggling with anxiety and panic disorder for decades it was raines twin sister who stepped in urging raines to find a purpose for her pain. that purpose came in 2017 when raines joined a church group on a feeding mission. i went to skid row i m like oh this is where all the broken people are oh i ve been looking for y all all my life she said. i never wanted to leave. it s a place where people have amazing hearts but nobody can see it because they ca n t see the forest for the trees. at first raines who sports brightly colored hair and makeup passed out clothing food and water. but when several skid row residents complimented her appearance she offered to do their hair and makeup. i started with the trans community raines said. they were telling me that no one would give them women s clothes because they were men. i m like girl i ll bring you some women s clothes. i ll bring wigs i ll bring you eyelashes. raines saw the immediate lift in their spirit when their souls were cared for. it plants a little bit of self esteem in them so they feel like ok maybe no one knows i m homeless because i have a fresh cut she said. early on raines teamed up with a community group of motorcycle enthusiasts called fighters for the world mc who accompany her on skid row to provide safety and structure. they re like big brothers raines said. a lot of the homeless would get lost. they could n t find us but they learned to follow the sounds of the bikes. as raines efforts evolved into a full scale operation with music playing and lines forming around the block she began providing more supplies and essentials rape whistles tents sleeping bags hygiene items and she teamed up with local health officials to offer more services. heidi behforouz medical director for housing for health a program of the county department of health services has worked with raines on the streets and says she is giving people hope a break dignity some fun . just reminding us that we re all human. i think shirley represents the best of us behforouz said. there are common denominators that we all share. and i think it s critical in this moment when we ve all been through relative trauma to have moments of peace and happiness and dignity. before the pandemic raines was making 400 meals a week in her one bedroom apartment kitchen in long beach and driving three times a week to downtown los angeles to feed and bring supplies to people. then as covid 19 affected many organizations efforts services dried up. but raines pivoted opting for bagged lunches and a tweaked schedule and she kept going. when i went out there it was like a scene from the walking dead raines said. all the resources had stopped. people stopped coming to feed. some people had socks tied around their face around their nose. raines struggled to find enough drinking water and food to purchase so she appealed to her followers over social media who stepped up with donations and supplies. in tandem with the health department which provided masks sanitizer and ppe raines said her group and other county non profits and community projects worked tirelessly to serve the unseen community. we just had to use our best judgment and figure out some ways to still keep them fed while keeping them safe and while keeping us safe raines said. today as vaccination rates are on the rise and a sense of normality is returning raines is offering help by way of food and supplies twice a week and expanding partnerships with local groups to let this often overlooked population know there is hope. my sun did n t come out for 30 years. it was 30 years worth of tomorrows before i even saw the break of day. i would be lying if i said i was always completely happy from doing this. it did n t take away the pain of my son dying. but i ve certainly gotten better. i can say his name now. he is the reason i do what i do.

other,"morton texas reuters the phone rang non stop in emily herrera s office at the cochran memorial hospital. it was mid february and the small town of morton in far west texas had just received its first doses of the moderna coronavirus vaccine just a few weeks after a beloved physician s assistant had died and not long after the hospital s clinic was forced to close for two weeks because all the staff were sick with covid 19. herrera a 28 year old nurse was asked to organize the inoculation effort. patients and doctors would make 800 mile 1290 km round trip drives from austin and elsewhere to obtain vaccines. herrera had a waiting list with over 900 names. and then it was just like one day people stopped calling. people stopped coming in she said. herrera was not alone as she watched vaccine demand dry up beginning in early april. public health experts say vaccination drives around the united states began to fall off sharply at the same time resulting in president joe biden missing his stated goal of having 70 of americans aged 18 and older at least partially vaccinated by july 4. the centers for disease control on thursday said that of adults had taken at least one dose. biden visited north carolina on thursday to make the case for more people to get vaccinated. a combination of problems with access along with mistrust about the vaccines and how quickly they were rolled out are the biggest challenges health officials said. morton is the county seat of cochran county. just 37 of its residents are at least partially vaccinated according to the texas department of state health services far below the national figure of according to the cdc. cochran county is 61 latino and one fifth of its 2800 residents are living in poverty according to the census bureau. polling data from the kaiser family foundation shows a gap between non hispanic whites who say they have received the vaccine 65 versus latinos at 57 . complete consistent data on the racial breakdowns of who has received the vaccine is not available from most states. kaiser polling also shows that people making less money are far less likely to have received a vaccine with their data showing that 42 of those making less than 40000 a year are unvaccinated as opposed to 19 unvaccinated among those making 90000 a year or more. reuters interviewed 14 unvaccinated people aged 36 and younger in cochran county and neighboring hockley county this week. concerns about the speed with which vaccines were developed and a general view that younger people were less likely to fall ill were the most cited reasons for not taking the shot. covid is not a hoax i m not one of those people i m not an anti vaxxer said michelle martinez a 27 year old working at the r h grill in morton. but these vaccines were just developed extremely quickly. rupali j. limaye an expert in vaccine behavior at johns hopkins said vaccination rates were especially lagging in communities of color. the biggest reason for those disparities limaye argues is access. problems include distance to vaccine centers not being able to get time off work to get a shot language barriers and mistrust of the healthcare system. rebecca weintraub faculty director of the global health delivery project at harvard university said that even before covid 19 vaccine hesitancy had been steadily increasing. the best weapons in wooing people into taking the vaccine were local physicians along with church and community leaders and having easy constant access to the shots. the vaccine should be on the menu at all times including when you re seeing a primary care provider or any other provider in a health care setting she said. we have n t done that yet. nick honesto a 36 year old in morton had an uncle and a friend die from covid 19 but said he still is not convinced to take the vaccine. the shot is one thing that puts a lot of fear in me it s got me really spooked he said. how can other vaccines take years and years to come up with but this one comes out right away more testing needs to be done to convince me.

politics,"a 10 year sunset date has been added to little rock mayor frank scott jr. s proposed rebuild the rock sales tax increase of 1 percentage point according to city meeting materials released friday. under scott s original proposal the tax increase would have been permanent. members of the city board of directors will have the opportunity to vote to call a sept. 14 special election on the tax increase during a meeting tuesday at southwest high school. three items comprising the tax increase including an ordinance to call the election that stipulates the tax increase will cease dec. 31 2031 after 10 years were added to the board s agenda as part of the meeting materials uploaded to the city s website friday. during a board meeting tuesday ward 3 city director kathy webb had requested that the sales tax items be added to the agenda for the next meeting. webb made a motion last month to table scott s sales tax package until july 13 and the board approved the motion in an 8 2 vote. the decision effectively closed the door on the possibility city directors would approve a july 13 special election as scott had requested. in a phone interview friday webb said she plans to vote yes on the measure to call a special election citing adjustments to the tax package and more robust discussion of federal dollars from the most recent federal stimulus legislation. document click here to read the resolution on the uses for a proposed little rock sales tax . my intention from the beginning as i said was to get to yes but i think i have a responsibility to listen to my constituents who have typically been among the most supportive residents of little rock when it comes to issues like this webb said. and they had a lot of concerns so i think it was my job to do due diligence and address those concerns. her announcement means the tax package is one vote closer to securing approval at the city board which has been divided over the proposal. the city board must call an election before the measure can be referred to voters in an up or down referendum. in a tweet friday looking ahead to the meeting scott wrote the revised rebuildtherock proposal will be presented and we re hopeful the members will pass this initiative to unite grow transform our city . senior mayoral adviser kendra pruitt could not be reached for comment immediately by phone or email friday. a new version of a resolution stating the planned uses of the new tax revenue now includes specific projects or initiatives under each category. for some categories spending is further divided into planned operating and capital expenses. scott s proposal would use an estimated 53 million in new annual revenue from the tax to fund improvements to parks bolster community oriented policing add exhibits to the little rock zoo and create more high quality early childhood education offerings. under the proposal an estimated 37 million over 10 years would fund construction of an indoor sports complex and an estimated 30 million in capital funding would go toward hindman and war memorial parks. when the tax proposal was rolled out earlier this year around the same time city officials said an existing three eighths percent sales tax used for capital improvements would be allowed to expire at the end of december after 10 years. if voters approve scott s tax increase later this year because of the expiring tax the overall sales tax rate in little rock would increase by five eighths of a percentage point to when accounting for state and county sales taxes. the increase would take effect in january. in the event of a narrowly divided board tuesday the mayor will need at least five yes votes among the 10 city directors in order to exercise his power to cast a tiebreaking vote. ordinarily the mayor does not get to vote on measures before the board. in addition to webb a board member who could turn out to be a decisive voice on the revised tax package is ward 4 s capi peck. webb said she had met with the mayor several times and raised specific concerns. she added that he had met with others. i do n t know what all the outcomes were of course but i also know that people will be traveling some this summer so it seemed like the appropriate time to bring it back she said of the tax package. during the meeting in may when the board voted to table the package webb had raised concerns about forthcoming direct aid to the city from the federal american rescue plan act which congress passed and president joe biden signed in march. the city expects to receive million total and half of the money was received last month. additionally at the time webb said constituents had asked for more discussion of a possible sunset date or a continuation of the existing three eighths percent sales tax. webb said friday that she felt the dialogue about the federal dollars had opened up and referred to a recent presentation to the board on the money led by the city s director of strategic operations emily jordan cox. do i know what the people will decide but i will vote to send it out and then . the people will tell us what they want to do she said. with regard to the sunset date webb said that although she had not seen the written document she expected a sunset date to be part of the proposal. she said she hoped that another request from residents for more specificity on how the money will be spent would be included in the tax resolution. her comments were made before the release of the written materials on the city s website friday. scott first proposed a sales tax increase during his 2020 state of the city address but the effort was abandoned because of the coronavirus pandemic. he revived his push for a sales tax increase during his virtual state of the city broadcast on march 25. the decision to add a sunset date represents a retreat for scott but it may win over additional votes on the board and in the community for residents reluctant to approve an open ended tax increase. in late april john burgess chairman of the little rock regional chamber of commerce told scott in an email that the absence of a sunset date for the capital expenditure portion of the tax was the biggest single issue with the proposal raised by our leadership group and it s the single biggest issue that gets mentioned by those in our social networks.

politics,"madison assembly republicans plan to send bills to gov. tony evers on tuesday that would limit who can return absentee ballots on behalf of voters prevent election clerks from filling in missing information on absentee ballot paperwork and require disabled and elderly voters to show id to vote absentee. the democratic governor has signaled he will veto the bills. the legislation comes amid a nationwide fight over election laws. in wisconsin republicans have launched two reviews of the 2020 election even though recounts and a slew of court rulings confirmed joe biden s narrow win over donald trump in the state. senate bill 203 would limit who could return absentee ballots for others. the measure is meant to prevent what republicans disparage as ballot harvesting having political groups collect absentee ballots so they can deliver them to election officials. large scale ballot collection didn t happen in wisconsin last year but a republican ballot collection scheme in north carolina in 2018 led to the invalidation of a congressional election and criminal charges. another provision of the bill would prevent activities like democracy in the park which allowed madison voters to return their absentee ballots last fall to poll workers who were stationed in more than 200 parks. senate bill 212 would bar election officials from filling in the addresses of witnesses on absentee ballot envelopes if they were missing. under current law ballots can t be counted if that information is missing. at the behest of republicans the state elections commission in 2016 told municipal clerks they could fill in missing witness addresses on ballot envelopes if they knew them. after the most recent election republicans balked at the practice and are seeking to end it. new id rules for disabled voters . the most sweeping bill assembly republicans plan to take up is senate bill 204 which would require elderly and disabled voters to produce ids to vote absentee in many cases. for the last decade most wisconsin voters have had to show an id to vote but the requirement does not apply to voters who say they are indefinitely confined to their homes because of age or disability. the bill would require confined voters to show an id to get ballots in most cases just like other voters must. confined voters who do not have an id could instead provide a statement from a witness to confirm their identity. under current law confined voters can have absentee ballots sent to them automatically for every election as long as they say they need them. the legislation would require them to apply to have ballots sent to them every year. under another part of the legislation the state would no longer recognize voters as indefinitely confined if they claimed that status during most of 2020. those voters would have to apply anew to be treated as a confined voter. republicans are focused on the issue because about 215000 confined voters cast ballots in november up from about 67000 in 2016. they question whether the voters last year were actually confined. groups representing the disabled and elderly say it s no surprise so many more people had to stay in their homes during the coronavirus pandemic. another part of senate bill 204 would require ordinary voters to fill out more paperwork when they vote absentee. wisconsin voters have long been able to fill out a single form on an absentee ballot envelope that serves as both an application for the ballot and a certification that they are the one who filled out the ballot. the bill would require voters to fill out two forms one to apply for an absentee ballot and one to certify they filled out the ballot. republicans are targeting absentee ballots after the state saw a surge in mail voting because of the pandemic. in november 41 of wisconsin voters cast ballots by mail compared with 5 in the 2016 presidential election. the bill would also require voters to provide a copy of their id every time they ask for an absentee ballot. now voters have to provide a copy of their id the first time they vote absentee but not after that. the bill would also bar election officials from sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications to voters as the state elections commission did last year with bipartisan support. under the legislation applications could be sent only if voters requested them. senate bill 205 would create a backup system for voting at nursing homes if poll workers are unable to visit the facilities. poll workers known as special voting deputies visit care facilities to help residents cast absentee ballots. typically the deputies work in teams of two with one democrat and one republican. the bill would allow nursing home workers who got election training to fulfill those duties if the voting deputies could not visit provided the nursing home workers belonged to different parties. the measure is a response to problems that emerged last year after nursing homes banned visitors including voting deputies because of the pandemic. election officials sent absentee ballots to nursing home residents instead of visiting them. senate bill 210 would allow observers during election recounts to sit or stand within 3 feet of poll workers. currently they are not allowed to be within 3 feet of the table where they work but cannot be told to stay more than 8 feet away from the table. senate bill 292 would require municipal clerks who livestream vote canvassing to maintain recordings of the livestream for 22 months after the election.

religion,"formula one 53 welcome to another installment of cars of future past a series here at jalopnik where we flip through the pages of history to explore long forgotten concepts and how they had a hand in shaping the cars we know today. today jaguar keeps the tradition of the front engine rear wheel drive british fastback and roadster alive with the f type a car i had to remind myself is still on sale but i m nevertheless thankful exists. the f type unveiled back in 2013 was a long time coming. the automaker had been grappling with a spiritual successor to the famed e type for the better part of three decades before the one we all know ultimately hit showrooms. that explains the subject of today s car of future past. part retrofuturistic e type part xk8 the 2000 f type concept stole the 2000 detroit auto show. but despite the public s eagerness to drive it and jaguar s eagerness to mint a successor to its most iconic product this f type died before it ever left the factory. jaguar . the 2000 f type concept represents an inflection point in jaguar design. it was the last project geoff lawson then chief of design spearheaded before his sudden passing in june 1999. three designers working under lawson keith helfet adam hatton and pasi pennanen carried the assignment the rest of the way. lawson was ultimately succeeded by ian callum who presented the car in detroit. however callum takes no credit for its creation. he told top gear some years back that the f type was essentially completed by the time he arrived at the company. that s the first interesting detail of note about the f type concept. the other is that the car s design actually wasn t all that original in the first place. two years earlier helfet penned a very similar looking one off called the xk 180. the xk 180 was built atop a shortened xk8 chassis and many of its cues would be repeated and refined in the f type concept. that s particularly evident from the rear where the xk 180 s circular led taillamps tapered and curved rear deck and wide oval cutout for the license plate all appeared first before they were shuffled and reshaped a bit in the later concept. the side profile is pretty familiar as well though the f type lost the xk 180 s subtle trim and speedster style roll hoop treatment. instead it tacked on funky side mirrors that looked like alien ears. 1998 jaguar xk 180 concept jaguar . that might seem somewhat underwhelming though it s important to stress that jaguar wasn t intending this car to be a flagship grand tourer the brand already had that in the xk. the f type was positioned as more of a boxster adversary and in that context the powertrain makes a bit more sense. jaguar was also very keen to point out at the time that this was the most compact car the company had attached its badge to in nearly half a century. inside the total distaste for sharp edges and corners was carried to the dash and door cards. it s kind of fascinating how spartan the interior was considering the rather forward looking exterior design. all the real estate was saved for analog dials and aircraft style toggle switches with not even a monochrome lcd screen in sight. the gravest offense is that stubby shifter though this concept was a manual and that thing looks like a pain to operate. while the current production f type evokes the e type in spirit the 2000 concept was a visual homage too. that s not to say that the existing f type should have been more retro but rather that lawson and his team set out to strike a balance between jaguar s past and future with this exercise and they largely nailed it. i m going to get my enthusiast card revoked here for confessing that i never much liked the design of the original e type particularly the coupe. the convertible was simple and elegant enough but to me the coupe always resembled a clown shoe. the f type concept wasn t a like for like copy of the original design though it did honor its inspiration in small ways. one was the shut line for the hood which dropped down vertically between the front wheel arch and the leading edge of the door. in profile the concept was simple and unfussy it had that fuselage silhouette to it that the e type is recognized for and the low cut windshield did well to keep the mass streamlined. jaguar could never get away with that canopy in a production car but here in the land of what ifs nothing was off the table. of course it didn t but the reasons why are both intriguing and infuriating. the f type concept was reportedly well liked within jaguar and its corporate owner ford. the latter was a good sign as ford was responsible for canceling jaguar s earlier attempts to realize an f type in the 80s with the ill fated xj41 and xj42 projects. those cars ended up transmogrifying into the aston martin db7 in a roundabout way it s a fascinating tale i promise but not one we have the space to get into right now. 1986 jaguar xj42 prototype jaguar . anyway callum and his team had the unenviable task of taking a design that was very much geared for gawking at on the auto show floor and manifesting it as a road legal vehicle. and that was going to be a tall order primarily because of the aforementioned windshield situation. this was an exciting and promising proposal yet again to establish a jag two seater the name clearly signaled its intention. but although it caught the imagination of many including ford boss jacques nasser and design boss j mays who both loved the car the design was fundamentally flawed. it worried me at the unveiling because i knew that by the time it had gone through all its legal and feasibility requirements it could look quite ordinary. we continued with the design to make it feasible but the required windscreen height and legal bonnet height took so much away from the exciting proportions. so jaguar had every desire to realize this particular incarnation of the f type but it simply wasn t going to happen looking anything like the vehicle showgoers fell in love with. however that gave callum another idea because he reckoned he could get the car to look right if the engine moved behind the driver. that project was called the x600 and callum said it got pretty far it was canned in favor of diesel engine development. the x600 has never been shown to the public but callum seemed mighty proud of it he compared it to a boxster in size and praised its sophisticated rear suspension. once again the dream of an e type for the modern era was thwarted though not forever. jaguar unveiled a coupe at the 2011 frankfurt motor show dubbed the c x16 and that car that would later be christened the f type in production. the third time actually proved the charm. can you drive it in a video game . this forgotten f type was featured in one game as far as i m aware an also forgotten semi realistic racer known here in the states as apex. elsewhere it was titled racing evoluzione. apex was a decent xbox exclusive racer developed by milestone the folks who make the vast majority of motorcycle games that exist anymore and released in 2003. its claim to fame was its unique career mode where you didn t just race on behalf of a team but also ran an automaker deciding which cars to greenlight for production. it was a neat idea that another game really ought to have explored in greater depth at some point over the last two decades but alas.

disaster,"anchorage alaska ap alaska wildlife troopers do not intend to issue a citation to a man who was seen lifting a baby moose over a guardrail in south central alaska over the weekend though it is illegal to handle any wild animal in a similar fashion an alaska state troopers spokesperson said thursday. spokesperson austin mcdaniel said alaska wildlife troopers strongly advise people to stay a safe distance from all wildlife including moose calves as the animal may react aggressively towards humans. alaska s news source reported an anchorage man joe tate was driving home sunday from a fishing trip with friends when he saw a line of cars and a moose in the road on the kenai peninsula. tate said a mother moose was pacing in the road and a young calf struggled to scale a guardrail to join her. he estimated watching for about 30 minutes. he said he considered calling wildlife officials or law enforcement but worried an accident could occur in the time it would take for them to arrive. friends with a trailer got between the mother and the calf breaking the line of sight tate said. another vehicle positioned itself similarly on the opposite side of traffic. tate said he then lifted the calf over the guardrail and helped it steady itself on the pavement before letting it return to the adult moose. it was calculated tate said. it was something we kind of looked at and talked about before we did it. it worked out for the best. and it could have gone bad and i understand and know that. but it did go for the best and it was worth the risk that i took. more news .

crime,"kalinovik bosnia and herzegovina afp . the triumphant face of war criminal ratko mladic stares out of a roadside mural in his hometown with a caption hailing him simply as a hero a view still shared by most bosnian serbs. mladic who will hear the decision of his final appeal against his conviction next tuesday prosecuted bosnia s 1992 1995 civil war with ferocity against civilians and soldiers alike. a tribunal based in the hague jailed the 78 year old former general for life in 2017 for war crimes including the 1995 massacre of more than 8000 muslim men and boys at srebrenica the only incident in the war classed as genocide. but radosav zmukic head of a local veterans group in mladic s hometown of kalinovik believes that this judgment could not be further from the truth. everyone is proud that he is from here zmukic says recalling that he had met mladic two or three times during the 1992 1995 war and was impressed by his boldness . crimes were committed by all sides. but such a soldier was not capable of ordering the killing of people especially not civilians zmukic tells afp from his small dark office in the town hall. for the muslim survivors the continued denial of wartime atrocities embodied in the hero worship of men like mladic is the main obstacle in the path to reconciliation in a country still deeply divided along ethnic lines. tribunals humiliated serbs . yet the denial of wartime culpability seems to have grown in recent years along with reverence for the likes of mladic and political leader radovan karadzic. milorad dodik the long time leader of bosnia s ethnic serb entity republika srpska once agreed with international judges that the srebrenica massacre the worst atrocity in europe since world war ii amounted to genocide. now he claims he was manipulated into thinking that international tribunals were treating the issue fairly. the attitude of the hague tribunal towards serb victims is humiliating and unfair dodik told local media after mladic s 2017 conviction highlighting that 70 percent of those put on trial were ethnic serbs. dodik was also gushing in his praise for mladic after the conviction saying no court ruling could take away the position of a hero that had been reserved for him for many years . that attitude filters through bosnian serb society. mladic and the people he was leading are all innocent says serb veteran ljubo tomovic in foca another town that suffered mass killings of muslims by serbs during the war. here again mladic is memorialised in a mural this time with the caption thanks to your mother . bosnia s war between its croats muslims and serbs claimed nearly 100000 lives almost two thirds of whom were muslims according to an independent commission. the war left the country split into two entities the muslim croat federation and the republika srpska. bosnian muslims have long campaigned for the denial of genocide and war crimes to be outlawed. but serb mps in the central parliament have blocked all attempts to pass the law. i do not understand why it is still acceptable to deny to call such a man innocent even worse to call him a hero says almasa salihovic whose brother abdulah was killed at srebrenica. salihovic is spokeswoman for the srebrenica memorial which oversees a cemetery just outside the town with the graves of more than 6600 identified victims. whoever denies the genocide is also a war criminal says efendic who heads one of several groups representing the mothers of victims.

environmental,"biden administration report follows amy s announcement of cathode precursor production from recycled lithium ion battery waste . amy currently working with doe and dod members of a newly designated government battery recovery and recycling task force . surrey bc accesswire june 8 2021 american manganese inc. tsxv amy otcqb amyzf fse 2am amy or the company is pleased to offer comments on the new white house report on building resilient supply chains released today in response to president joe biden s february 2021 executive order directing a 100 day battery supply chain review including the recycling of critical and strategic minerals. the white house report sees the growing volume of spent lithium ion batteries as a resource too often lost to landfills or shipped abroad for recoveries. when the white house says that domestic economical recycling could reduce exports of valuable resources and increase the quantity available to the battery supply chain we could not agree more said larry reaugh president and ceo of american manganese inc. this is the strongest statement to date that indicates momentum is building to bring public policy in line with private sector innovation to meet the massive new needs for critical minerals. the white house report included the following recommendations . to secure cobalt supply and guard against price fluctuations the united states could consider investing in battery recycling infrastructure and technology development. immediate focus should include investment to increase capacity and scale up of recycling facilities and investigation of pathways for early federal purchase of recycling waste streams to the furthest extent possible. executive actions could include grants loans and policies to encourage safe domestic recycling. some examples of potential legislative actions could include tax incentives a landfill ban an extended producer responsibility mandate or a recycling mandate. the white house report comes as amy s recyclico battery recycling work continues to progress. the report noted that during cell manufacture production scrap is a key source of material for recycling mr. reaugh noted. american manganese has been conducting recycling tests with battery cell manufacturing scrap since we commissioned our pilot plant in 2019 and are pleased to be recognized in the report as a north american recycler . however to encourage the domestic recycling of battery production scrap we need north american cathode and battery manufacturing capacity to integrate our recycling technology alongside them otherwise recycled material would be shipped overseas to manufacture new battery cells. the 100 day battery supply chain review follows american manganese s recent press release regarding the production of cathode precursor material directly from recycled lithium ion battery nmc lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathode waste. as a pioneer in advanced battery recycling amy is continuously innovating and enhancing its process because as indicated in the report in the longer term new technologies will expedite cost effective recycling. the white house report also directed that the united states should establish targeted incentives and strategic stockpiling for recycling and purification infrastructure and form a battery recovery and recycling task force consisting of doe epa doi usgs dot commerce and dod. given the work american manganese is doing in partnership with the department of energy s critical materials institute and our project funded by the defense logistics agency to demonstrate our ability to use amy s patented process to produce emm from the low grade manganese resource in dod s wenden arizona stockpile we believe american manganese can be a strong private sector partner in the government s new battery recovery and recycling task force added mr. reaugh. the full report building resilient supply chains revitalizing american manufacturing and fostering broad based growth can be read here. american manganese inc. is a critical metals company focused on the recycling of lithium ion batteries with the recyclico patented process. the recyclico patented process was developed to offer a closed loop and environmentally friendly solution for the recycling of cathode materials used in lithium ion batteries. the recycling process provides high extraction and purity of cathode metals such as lithium cobalt nickel manganese and aluminum. the recyclico process was designed with the goal to produce recycled

unrest,"provided by the canadian press . toronto new data shows the number of violent incidents in toronto shelters has more than tripled during the covid 19 pandemic a phenomenon those who use the system say is partially driving an increase of outdoor encampments. city data reveals there were on average 120 violent incidents per month in the shelter system in 2016. that increased to an average of 270 incidents per month in 2020 and peaked at 368 incidents in january 2021. in total there have been 11677 violent incidents between march 2016 and mid february 2021. the data which was obtained through freedom of information laws and provided to the canadian press shows the number of overdoses also increased. the city maintains its shelter system is safe and wants the hundreds living in makeshift tents and encampments to move inside. the shelter system needs to be torn down from the bottom all the way to the top and needs to be reassessed he says. the 60 year old has lived in the shelter system for eight years. he has too many stories of violence to remember them all but says he learned quickly to lay low and expect the unexpected. the slightest accidental jostle and fists are flying and tables are all over the place eschbach says. it s just insane but what s really insane is the randomness nothing leads you to see it go off and then all of a sudden there s this explosion of fury and violence and blood. while in the shower one day he says a naked man attacked him and tried to rape him. eschbach delivered a quick punch and was able to slip away. he says he s seen friends knocked out and countless others robbed. he s lived in fear during much of his time in shelters. brian cleary s shelter odyssey began in the absolutely miserable basement of an old church. he s bounced around the systems ince then and witnessed violence first hand. one night a few years back the man in the cot next to his spilled juice all over cleary s shoes and sleep apnea machine. as cleary was cleaning up the mess the man jumped and choked him prompting staff to kick them both out. gru whose legal name is jesse allan says he has not suffered physical violence at the various shelters he s lived in but has witnessed a ton of violence there. it is why he prefers to live outside. i do n t feel safe in the shelters he says. when he first arrived in toronto six years ago after breaking up with his girlfriend gru said he could n t afford first and last month s rent. he had a full time job as a bike courier bought a nice tent and lived in a ravine for a time. but toronto s brisk downtown bicycle courier business evaporated almost overnight when the pandemic hit last march. gru terrified of contracting covid 19 and keen to steer clear of people opted to get out of town for the summer and spent months touring around southwestern ontario on his bike. when he returned he lived for several weeks in the don valley. that s when he heard about the encampments and the supports being offered by volunteers and outreach workers. gord tanner the city s director of homelessness initiatives and prevention services admits there s been a rise in violence in the shelters. in many ways i think that runs parallel to the fact that we re working with some people that have more complex needs now related to whether it s untreated health or mental health issues or substance use he says. tanner says the demographics of shelter users began shifting in 2020 with more singles and fewer families tapping into the system. he says he believes the shift may be related to the spike in violent incidents. tanner said the city has increased training for front line staff including de escalation techniques. eschbach cleary and gru all hope the shelter system can be changed. all three men ended up in the city s hotel program for the homeless and say they feel safer in their own rooms that lock. but issues remain according to gru who says security guards performed wellness checks three times a day at a downtown hotel the city leased for those who were previously living outside. gru says the checks involved guards using their keys to enter rooms at will including late at night when occupants may be in bed. it s the same surveillance and harassment systems that we have out in the parks where police officers come through on a regular basis to keep an eye on us. he says he persuaded management to stop the wellness checks after weeks of negotiations. eschbach is on a waiting list for housing and hopes to move into a new downtown building the city is refurbishing to provide supportive housing for 250 people. he s been staying at the comfort hotel near the pearson international airport while he waits. he does n t see as much violence there but it does still happen. during his first week for instance he says one resident went nuts and trashed the lobby launching computers everywhere and terrifying the receptionist. eschbach feels the big downside to the hotel is the isolation. i m in the middle of nowhere he says referring to the hotel s location in a sprawling suburb well west of central toronto. if i want to go pick up something from the pharmacy i have to walk a mile and i m disabled. it s the land of the car and homeless people have all their supports downtown. cleary moved to the same hotel as eschbach in june 2020 and shared similar concerns. in march cleary won the lottery of sorts when the city helped him find a rare rent geared to income apartment. i finally have some peace he says. i just wish my friends outside and in the shelters can get their own spot too.'

considering the theft a matter of national security with cash ending up in the hands of criminal groups based in russia china and nigeria. more than 70 of the 400 billion feared to have been stolen was pilfered by state backed foreign criminal groups haywood talcove told axios. these groups are definitely backed by the state said talcove the ceo of lexisnexis risk solutions. street gangs

axios that much of the fraud happened during the administration of former president donald trump. widespread fraud at the state level in pandemic unemployment insurance during the previous administration is one of the most serious challenges we inherited sperling told axios. president biden has been clear that this type of activity from criminal syndicates is despicable and unacceptable. it is why we passed 2 billion for ui modernizations in the american rescue plan instituted a department of justice anti fraud task force and an all of government identity theft and public benefits initiative. experts and politicians had assumed that some money would be stolen through fraud as unemployment systems in states across the country were not prepared to handle the demands of the pandemic. however the estimates provided by hall and talcove show the incredible extent of possible unemployment insurance fraud over the last year. axios explained that some thieves were likely able to defraud the government by stealing people s personal information to impersonate them and claim the money while others may have tricked real claimants into giving them their information. once the information was stolen lower level criminals called mules would withdraw the money from atms and convert it to bitcoin which can be sent in a way that is impossible to trace to transfer it abroad. the department of labor notes on its website that most victims of unemployment identity theft are unaware that claims have been filed and collected using their identities. many people only find out unemployment identity theft occurred when they receive something in the mail such as a payment or state issued 1099 g tax form that s incorrect or for benefits not received the

following his reinstatement by archdiocese of chicago after decades old sexual abuse allegations against minors sunday june 6 2021 in the auburn gresham neighborhood in chicago. chicago ap an activist roman catholic priest cleared by an archdiocese of chicago investigation into claims that he sexually abused several boys decades ago returned to the pulpit of his longtime church on sunday for the first time in five months. michael pfleger repeatedly told congregants of the faith community of st. sabina describing his time away during the investigation as a painful nightmare. pfleger 72 was placed on leave in january amid allegations from two brothers who said pfleger sexually abused them as children starting in the 1970s. a third man later also alleged that pfleger molested him once in 1979 when he was 18. last month the archdiocese concluded there was insufficient reason to suspect that pfleger had abused children. his first service back at the largely black church on chicago s south south was as spirited as ever with live music dancing and reenergized congregants who have fiercely backed their priest. pfleger who is white thanked congregants for supporting him and vowed to resume his activism especially against gun violence with even more gusto. i m going to fight harder because i m stronger i m better and i m wiser. the last five months have been a roller coaster of hurt and anger and depression and pain and not knowing what people are thinking about you he said his voice breaking at times. to support pfleger church members have held rallies flooded archdiocese phone lines threatened to withhold church dues and launched a letter writing campaign. on sunday some wore t shirts featuring the priest s photo and the message pfleger is back. among those in attendance was filmmaker spike lee who is friends with pfleger and whose 2015 movie chi raq featured a character inspired by pfleger and played by john cusack. pfleger is known for his anti violence activism and for bolstering neighborhood development in the largely low income neighborhood surrounding the church. he s also been in the spotlight for clashing with church leaders having been suspended twice before this year including in 2008 during barack obama s presidential campaign when he mocked obama s primary opponent hillary clinton. ordained in 1975 and assigned to st. sabina pfleger became pastor six years later and lived at the nearby rectory until earlier this year when he temporarily moved to an apartment during the investigation. police have said their investigation remains open and active but they have n t provided any details about it. cook county state s attorney kim foxx has said police haven t presented any information for her office to review or determine if criminal charges are appropriate. illinois has no statute of limitations for filing charges in major sex crimes. the illinois department of children and family services completed its review in february concluding there was no credible evidence of child abuse or neglect. the agency which does n t investigate allegations of abuse by an adult victim focused on whether children were currently at risk. during sunday s service pfleger talked about street violence in chicago. he also acknowledged the damage that the abuse allegations did to his reputation. he did n t talk about the allegations in detail aside from saying the false accusations to destroy his character began with an extortion letter. one of the brothers who are in their 60s has acknowledged that he asked pfleger for a 20000 payment in december. i know my name will be damaged for the rest of my life pfleger said as congregants booed. but most of that is by people that hated me anyway. there are people watching

arts,"the south got something to say curator karen comer lowe. lowe s concept for the show was also inspired by the last presidential election and the influential role atlanta voters played in the contest. i m a native atlantan and i never thought i would see the state of georgia vote blue. when that happened i really started to think about atlanta and its influence from trap music to the predominance of atlanta as a film location says lowe. lowe was asked to curate this second iteration of the outdoor digital exhibition by arts entertainment atlanta an economic development project of the city of atlanta that combines outdoor media like billboards with art and advertisement in public spaces. local art organization dashboard debuted the first digital sign project in june 2020. the signs are intended to authentically reflect the vibrancy diversity and creativity of the city as a whole says fredalyn frasier project director of central atlanta progress and the atlanta downtown improvement district which manages a e atlanta. the goal of the project is undeniably to get atlantans downtown as well as increase the exposure of atlanta based artists. and its placement couldn t be more high profile. the artworks are installed at four downtown sites 235 peachtree street 101 marietta street reverb by hard rock hotel at 89 centennial olympic park and 75 martin luther king jr. drive. each digital sign features artwork by two or three artists that rotates with commercial advertisements which in turn help fund the cost of the project as well as other a e atlanta programming. of the 10 artists involved only one kojo griffin created an original work for the exhibition a wry word search that snakes up the largest of the signs with the words those southern roots run deep circled in red. it s located on the side of reverb hotel. other works says lowe were selected to capture someone s attention in a split second. so i had to think about work in that way. work by fahamu pecou on the side of reverb by hard rock hotel. courtesy of erin sintos . she also wanted to represent the diversity of atlanta s art scene with long established artists such as jamele wright kojo griffin fahamu pecou and alfred conteh next to a nationally prominent group of younger emerging artists such as ariel dannielle a former moca ga working artist fellow and shanequa gay whose work is in the private collections of actor samuel l. jackson and scad hong kong. the south got something to say is lowe s first public art project and it presented multiple challenges. counterintuitive in many ways curating the exhibition was like choosing artwork to fit into preselected frames. lowe had to figure out how to make her selected artworks function within the parameters of these large horizontal and vertical signs the largest of which the reverb sign is 102 feet high by 29 feet wide. for participating artists like jamele wright a faculty member in the art department at georgia gwinnett college exhibiting his work in such a public space after more than a year in quarantine was a chance to channel happy positive feelings. wrapped around the corner of 235 peachtree st. his colorful abstract work is inspired by his repeated quarantine viewings of the 1978 motown productions musical the wiz. wright says about his quarantine experience. i was tired of watching tv and i was tired of watching the news. jamele wright s flat splat just like that 2 at 235 peachtree st. courtesy of erin sinto . credit erin sinto . wright stitched together multiple canvases to create flat splat just like that 2 a kinetic frieze of slime greens punchy reds and cornflower blues that virtually pop out of its billboard parameters. flat splat feels like a paean to a freshly reopened cityscape of graffiti neon and attention arresting signage. other works are more connected to issues of social injustice like shanequa gay s ode to kathryn johnston an excerpt from a performance piece that towers over 101 marietta. the piece references the 2006 police shooting of a 92 year old atlantan in her home 14 years before the eerily similar no knock warrant and killing of breonna taylor in louisville kentucky. much of the impact of the work in the south got something to say is black bodies writ large dominating the streetscape in the form of fahamu pecou s shirtless man in flux or alfred conteh s typically heartfelt portrait of a contemplative older man terrance. many of the participating artists including gerald lovell ariel dannielle and jurell cayetano are part of a growing movement both nationally and locally of revisionist portraiture of black subjects. drive. courtesy of jurell cayetano . joy is often the theme in the south got something to say whether in wright s brilliant color palette or in jurell cayetano s image of two laughing simpatico female friends in his 2017 portrait rochelle brittany. cayetano welcomed the chance to exhibit alongside a multigenerational cast of atlanta artists. it s an honor to be a part of this group he says. being recognized by people that are further along in their career than me lets me know that i m on the right path. in some ways the south got something to say is the perfect post quarantine project. it provides a chance for artists to flex their talent in an accessible dramatically outsized space a chance for audiences to experience creativity without having to pay for it and a chance to connect after more than a year of isolation. for lowe the south got something to say is an opportunity to open up the often insular art world to the larger public. art event .

crime,"getty images laurent gbagbo was the first former head of state to go on trial at the icc . former ivory coast president laurent gbagbo is expected to return home 10 years after he was taken to the international criminal court icc on charges of crimes against humanity. mr gbagbo has been living in the belgian capital brussels since his release from detention three years ago. his successor and rival president alassane ouattara invited him back. he was the first former head of state to go on trial at the icc but was acquitted of all charges. the 76 year old was charged after his refusal to accept defeat in a 2010 election triggered a civil war that left 3000 people dead. he always denied all the allegations. in march the icc appeals court upheld a 2019 acquittal saying the prosecution had failed to prove its case against mr gbagbo and charles bl goud an ally and former youth leader who was accused of leading a militia backing him. born in the south central region of gagnoa in 1945 to a catholic family mr gbagbo was educated in a christian seminary and later became a history professor. he cut his political teeth in the trade union movement where he became a vocal opponent of ivory coast s then one party state. he started out on the political left but in the 1980s took a strong nationalist stance which critics say bordered on xenophobia. after 20 years in opposition he was finally elected president in 2000 but civil war broke out just two years later. mr gbagbo s supporters were accused of carrying out xenophobic attacks in areas they controlled against those from the mainly muslim north immigrants from neighbouring african countries and westerners. they accused former colonial power france and the un of not doing enough to put down a rebellion which had split ivory coast into two with rebels allied with mr ouattara seizing the north. the crisis led to the postponement of the 2005 presidential elections six times before they were finally held in 2010 but mr gbagbo refused to concede defeat to mr ouattara after a runoff. the five months of violence that followed were described as some of the most brutal violence the country had ever seen. mr gbagbo said the dispute over ivory coast s presidency was a fight for ivorian and indeed african sovereignty and he accused the french and americans of siding against him. however this argument did not prevail and the african union backed the un s finding that mr gbagbo lost the election and should stand down. he was finally captured in april 2011 in a presidential palace bunker by un and french backed forces supporting mr ouattara. too early to judge impact of return . what mr gbagbo s return means and its impact is uncertain but for some ivorians the hope is that it will help reconcile the country and shift the government s attention to economic reforms and to dealing with the spillover of the islamist insurgency from neighbouring burkina faso and mali. however for many victims of mr gbagbo s rule time has not healed their physical and emotional wounds. his return is a reminder of the violence they suffered and the injustice they still endure. this west african nation wants peace in its borders to be achieved through reconciling its people whether it can achieve this without justice for victims of its civil wars only time will tell. why was gbagbo cleared by the icc . in 2019 the judges ruled that prosecutors had failed to demonstrate the existence of a common plan to keep mr gbagbo in power which included crimes against civilians or a policy to attack a civilian population . presiding judge cuno tarfusser said the prosecution had also failed to demonstrate that public speeches by gbagbo constituted ordering or inducing the alleged crimes . in march an icc appeals court upheld the acquittal dismissing the prosecution s argument that there were procedural errors in how the original verdict was delivered and that thousands of documents and 96 witnesses presented during the trial had proved the guilt of mr gbagbo beyond reasonable doubt. despite his acquittal at the icc he could still serve time in prison after ivorian authorities sentenced him in absentia in november 2019 for looting the central bank of west african states bceao in the aftermath of the 2010 disputed poll. the 20 year sentence had ruled him out of taking part in last year s election. after his acquittal president ouattara invited him to return to ivory coast which is still striving for political stability. mr gbagbo responded by saying he wanted to promote peace in his country. although bitterness and division remain a decade after the election and civil war observers say mr ouattara feels politically secure after winning a controversial third term last year and is therefore willing to reconcile with his political nemesis. getty images some of mr gbagbo s allies were welcomed home two months ago after years in exile . but others point to the 2018 amnesty given to mr gbagbo s wife simone and several others jailed for crimes committed during the 2010 11 crisis saying the reconciliation effort started a while ago. six other former allies of mr gbagbo returned two months ago after years in exile. this creates impunity and paves the way for other crimes issiaka diaby of the collective of victims in ivory coast told news agency afp.

science,"covid 19 infections in taiwan have jumped to more than 11000 with 308 deaths after a cluster initially detected among airline pilots spread . a subsidiary of taiwan s tech giant foxconn said tuesday it has temporarily suspended operations after six foreign workers tested positive for covid 19 in the latest outbreak within the industry. foxsemicon integrated technology is the semiconductor arm of the world s largest contract electronics maker foxconn that supplies major international brands including apple. the company which makes semiconductor manufacturing and inspection equipment said operations in its facilities in northern miaoli county will be suspended until wednesday for nearly 430 workers to undergo rapid screening. foxsemicon said in a filing to the taiwan stock exchange that its june output and revenue are expected to drop two to three percent due to the suspension of work. it is now the fourth tech company in miaoli to report infections among employees at a time when taiwan is battling a sudden surge of the virus. the island emerged largely unscathed from the pandemic last year with just a few hundred cases and single digit deaths thanks to one of the world s best coronavirus responses. but infections have jumped to more than 11000 with 308 deaths after a cluster initially detected among airline pilots spread. three other tech firms including leading chip testing and packaging company king yuan electronics company kyec have suspended migrant employees from working to contain cluster infections. so far 210 kyec employees have tested positive in the first major outbreak in taiwan s semiconductor industry which is operating at full capacity to meet a worldwide shortage. local media raised concerns that the suspension could impact the global chip shortage as kyec s business is a key final step in the semiconductor supply chain. the company supplies some top international tech firms such as intel qualcomm and nvidia. taiwan s semiconductor factories have been struggling to plug a pandemic driven shortage of chips that power essential electronic devices.

science,"the world is about to be deluged by artificial intelligence software that could be inside of a sticker stuck to a lamppost. what s called tinyml a broad movement to write machine learning forms of ai that can run on very low powered devices is now getting its own suite of benchmark tests of performance and power consumption. the test mlperf is the creation of the mlcommons an industry consortium that already issues annual benchmark evaluations of computers for the two parts of machine learning so called training where a neural network is built by having its settings refined in multiple experiments and so called inference where the finished neural network makes predictions as it receives new data. mlperf tiny inference as the new exam is called focuses on the new frontier of things running on smartphones down to things that could be thin as a postage stamp with no battery at all. the reference implementation for mlperf tiny inference tests how much latency is incurred and how much energy is consumed running four representative machine learning takss on an st microelectronics nucleo arm based microcontroller board for embedded systems. this completes the micro watts to megawatts benchmarks spectrum said david kanter the executive director of mlcommons the industry consortium that oversees mlperf in a briefing with press. also ai industry s performance benchmark mlperf for the first time also measures the energy that machine learning consumes . the tests measure latency in milliseconds and power consumption in micro jules to complete four representative machine learning tasks where lower is better in both cases. this is the second time that ml commons has introduced an energy measurement. in april the group introduced a measure of ac power used in watts into the existing mlperf inference test. tinyml represents fairly tasks that are familiar to many using mobile devices things such as the wake word that activates a phone such as hey google or hey siri. warden confided to the audience with a chuckle that he and colleagues have to refer to hey google around the office as hey g in order not to have one another s phones going off constantly. in this case the four tasks included keyword spotting but also three others what s called visual wake words where an object in a field of view triggers some activity think video doorbell image classification on the widely used cifar 10 data set and anomaly detection a visual inspection system that might be used in a factory floor. the benchmark was constructed by making a reference implementation where those four tasks are run on a small embedded computer board the st microelectronics nucleo l4r5zi which runs an arm cortex m4 embedded processor. the nucleo is deemed by ml commons to be in sufficiently wide use to represent very low power devices. the nucleo ran google s software system for tinyml called tensorflow lite in this case a version specially designed for microcontrollers. four groups submitted their results to the benchmark syntiant an irvine california based designer of ai processors latentai a menlo park california based spin out of research institute sri international that makes a developer sdk for ai peng cheng laboratory a research laboratory in shenzen china and hls4ml a collection of researchers from fermilab columbia university uc san diego and cern. syntiant ran the benchmark on an arm cortex m0 processor while latentai used a raspberry pi 4 system with a broardcom chip and hls4ml used a xilinx processor on a pynq z2 development board. perhaps the most interesting submission from a hardware standpoint was peng cheng laboratory s custom processor which it designed and which was fabricated by china s semiconductor manufacturing international. that part runs the open risc v instruction set a project of the university of california at berkeley that has been gaining increasing support as an alternative to arm chip instructions. a formal paper describing the benchmark is available for download on authored by two of the academic advisors to the organization colby banbury and vijay janapa reddi of harvard university along with multiple contributing authors. that paper has been submitted to this year s neurips the ai field s biggest academic conference. reddi of harvard said the design was a result of both voting by those advisors but also a process of selecting from among the suggestions. there is an element of group consensus and there is an element of feasibility said kanter meaning dealing with the limitations of what data sets can in practice be used for tests. if you are n t evaluating on a real data set you are not going to get super meaningful results he said. datasets such as cifar 10 ensure results will be comparable and well recognized he added. that s a gating factor said kanter of the dataset issue. there are a lot applications that we would love to be able to measure performance on but ultimately you sort of look at what are the availabe resources especially given this is an initial effort. one of the biggest challenges of benchmarking tinyml is that the software stack all the coding layers from hardware instruction sets on up through the frameworks of machine learning such as google s tensorflow lite constitute a much more varied collection of software than is usually found in programs written for pcs and supercomputers in tensorflow pytorch and nvidia s cuda software engine. the tests allow companies that submit to both use their own version of a neural network algorithm or to use a standard model the same as everyone else dubbed either open or closed benchmark results respectively. measuring power for battery based systems is very challenging noted kanter. the embedded board systems used in the test suite run in a controlled test set up where their absolute runtime power for the tasks is intercepted by a power monitor that is in fact supplying the power. we just cut out the entire battery subsystem said peter torelli president of the embedded microprocessor benchmark consortium a group that has for decades measured performance of embedded systems which worked on the energy component of the benchmark. also machine learning at the edge tinyml is getting big . in the real world a diverse set of circumstances will greet any device that actually runs in a mobile phone or a factory floor device. google s head of development for tinyml pete warden has argued that tinyml efforts should focus on devices that are battery powered with no wall socket connection. warden has suggested that even simpler tinyml devices could be using energy harvesting so that they do n t even have a battery but rather would be provided their energy via the sun or via heat emitting organisms or structures nearby. although in principle the ml commons is in accord with warden s view that many tinyml devices will have battery power only or energy harvesting the benchmarks include devices such as the raspberri pi that could be using a wall power source. at watts of power the raspberri pi is quite a bit larger than the micro watts of the smallest kinds of embedded systems. also google ai executive sees a world of trillions of devices untethered from human care .

unrest,"seattle king county officials have proposed emergency budget amendments meant to reduce gun violence after shootings last week in seattle s central district and pioneer square neighborhoods and in nearby white center that killed four people and injured two others. king county executive dow constantine unveiled the urgent budget proposal on tuesday reported. it includes million in investments to address the increase in gun violence through data driven identification of the groups and neighborhoods at the highest risk of being involved in a shooting increased community engagement and increasing community staffing with employees to connect community members to services and support opportunities. stopping the gun violence requires more than just a criminal justice response it requires the upstream public health based interventions we know can help unwind conflict and prevent future tragedies constantine said in a news release. there have been 253 shots fired incidents in the county in 2021 with 16 fatal shootings and 53 injuries data from the king county prosecuting attorney s office shows. the office says shots fired incidents are up 25 this year compared to the four year average with fatal shootings up 36 over that same time period.

economy,"the codeshare between azul and latam airlines brazil ran its course in a short period of time. if azul formalises its quest to acquire latam airlines brazil a lot of business and regulatory intricacies need consideration. there has been a solid amount of consolidation in brazil during the past decade and a half but the pandemic could usher new waves of rationalisation if needed. an end to a short lived codeshare creates intrigue in the strategic brazilian market . the abrupt end to the azul latam airlines brazil codeshare that launched in aug 2020 and subsequent reports in reuters that azul was pursuing an acquisition of latam airlines brazil could potentially shake up an already unsteady latin aviation landscape. latam airlines brazil s parent latam airlines group is restructuring under chapter 11 alongside avianca holdings and aeromexico. after latam sought bankruptcy protection in may 2020 latam airlines brazil sought similar protection in jul 2020. during its time in chapter 11 latam has exited argentina s market and entered into a codeshare agreement with azul that was designed to equip each airline with a different toolset during the recovery from the covid 19 crisis. at the beginning of 2021 azul s chief revenue officer abhi shah commented that exceptional circumstances make you think differently and to latam s credit it was open to the idea of codesharing. at the end of 2020 the codeshare between the two airlines covered 151 nonstop domestic routes and mr shah stated that it was a way for azul and latam to bring their networks back online as quickly as possible as well as reducing uncertainty. see related report capa live azul brazilian airlines uses a range of tools in crisis . but now the codeshare has ended with latam concluding that the expansion and volume of passengers that benefitted from the agreement did not meet its expectations in 2021. azul meanwhile said the cancellation of the codeshare was a reaction to its hiring of advisors to actively explore opportunities for consolidation. complexities abound if azul formally launches a campaign to acquire its rival . those opportunities appear to include a pursuit of latam airlines brazil which itself is the product of the 2012 merger of lan and tam. the tie up gave lan a key foothold in latin america s largest market and as of sep 2019 brazil represented 38 of latam s trailing revenue by point of sale. during a recent capa live conference latam airlines group ceo roberto alvo stated that 40 of our resources and our capacity sits in brazil . he highlighted latam s position as one of brazil s largest domestic airlines and its ability to provide global connectivity to and from brazil. see related report capa live latam airlines group ready for fierce competition . taking all of that into account it is not surprising that latam has been quoted in various media outlets declaring that it has no intention of selling its brazilian franchise. additionally latam and delta which has a 20 stake in latam have already gained approval from brazilian authorities for their proposed joint venture. of course if azul s overtures are formalised the bankruptcy court has to weigh in on an acquisition merger offer and it is unknown how the court would view that proffer. brazil s government would also have to evaluate the benefits merger between two of its largest airlines. in 2019 gol was brazil s domestic market leader with a 39 share followed by latam at 38 . avianca brazil ceased operations in 2019 and the three remaining airlines absorbed that capacity to varying degrees. based on 2019 market share data a combined azul latam airlines brazil would have an approximately 61 share which could raise some concerns among brazilian regulators. however there would be minimal route overlap and that could ease some competitive issues that could be raised. consolidation has been a regular occurrence in brazil in the recent past. there s also been a steady stream of consolidation in brazil dating back to 2007 when gol purchased varig. gol then acquired webjet in 2012. that was followed by azul s acquisition of trip in 2012. more recently azul has acquired flexjet to access smaller markets through the smaller airline s nine seat cessna caravans. obviously the pandemic has changed aviation markets worldwide and there has been discussion about potential consolidation in latin america. but it is tough to see how latam would give up its brazilian franchise. brazil s trips per capita in 2018 were compared with for peru and for the highly mature us market. brazil remains latin america s largest market and its potential post pandemic remains robust. at the capa live conference mr alvo also said that definitely three players in a market such as brazil can work very well. but it is tough to determine that regulators and the bankruptcy court will adopt the same view.additional consolidation is far from certain but ambition remains high . obviously the speculation about potential for consolidation in brazil raises more questions than answers. but azul is clearly drawing a line in the sand with its ambitions to usher in some form of additional consolidation in latin america. now it is time to wait and see if that ambition bears fruit.

labour,"throughout the pandemic people have turned to technology for support. whether it was reaching out to loved ones via zoom or relying on cloud technology to help businesses work remotely technology has been at the forefront. from investing in hardware to support employees making more use of social media to stay connected or prioritizing investment in more sophisticated technology such as ai and machine learning to improve ways of working it is clear that we would have been facing an incredibly different outlook if technology was not as advanced as it is today. in particular ai has been a powerful weapon in tackling the effects of coronavirus. from a medical standpoint the technology has been utilized in disease detection via thermal cameras to use in contact tracing assisting medical trusts in stopping the spread of the virus. it is fair to say that ai has been instrumental in navigating the last year or so. however the capabilities of ai and ml to address the challenges of the pandemic extend far beyond healthcare. it can also transcend into the working environment supporting businesses as they continue to find solutions to the permanent shifts created by covid 19. while staggered returns to office working seem to be the most likely option as the world opens up again machine learning and ai continue to help businesses respond to the problems of engaging and managing talent in a pandemic while revolutionizing the way they work. the pandemic enforced working from home and unfortunately furlough have resulted in a great uptick in talent movement and people looking for work sometimes in completely new industries. the rate of redundancies has accelerated and subsequently so have job applications last summer over 4000 people applied for a single entry level role. this sharp rise in job applicants has been combined with a revolution in the way talent is engaged. as more and more organizations are shifting their focus on their hiring policies they are looking to a new way of working that doesn t just focus on full time employees. instead businesses are increasingly turning to gig workers over permanent staff to deliver projects. engaging gig workers allows companies to reduce overheads in this difficult economic climate but it takes time to find the perfect person for a project. in both cases teams face an uphill battle sifting through cvs and a loss of time they can t afford. by engaging with the gig economy businesses can see increased efficiency in project management as well as freeing up time to engage with full time employees on more long term projects. ai has been used in talent engagement for a while but its value has rapidly increased during the pandemic. rather than an individual spending countless work hours reading through job applications ai driven data will instantly scan through cvs to pick those with the most suited skills or run analysis on video interviews. this not only saves businesses precious time and resources it leads to a fairer more effective process as every application is considered. no more need for desperate time saving tactics where only the first 50 submissions are reviewed and the rest are ignored. businesses can now gain back time and make sure they re choosing the right people for the role. this ability to filter through candidates at speed is a game changer during a pandemic and beyond. using skills matching tools empowers business to spread their nets wider and start engaging with talent overseas. it doesn t matter that expanding the talent search abroad will increase the number of applications the ai absorbs the extra work and means businesses can reach the very best international talent. it s this edge that sets a company apart allowing them to weather a global crisis and come out stronger on the other side. using ai to find team members can also help talent engagement address its bias problem. by partly removing humans from the equation ai can go some way in removing the unconscious bias that a human assessor brings for example in the judgment of a particular ethnicity of gender. however it s important to remember that ai is a tool not a panacea and won t eradicate systemic discrimination on its own. it s still coded by biased humans and can also be biased by its data set as cvs are experience based they are inherently biased towards certain groups. this has led some companies to explore other options and look towards test based models for engaging talent. as with all technology ai needs to be approached with proper thought and care. but it s not just in engaging talent that ai helps teams adjust to the effects of the pandemic. there s also a role for it to play in refining remote working. one of the biggest losses arising from remote working is the loss of in office human interaction interaction which is extremely valuable in sparking creativity and managing the health and wellbeing of teams. whilst addressing this loss might initially appear beyond the scope of ai there s real capacity for creative applications of ai techniques to start bringing back this lost office dimension. if ai can be used in conjunction with cloud based work management and collaboration systems it can start to learn about a team their work and the interactions between colleagues. this knowledge can then be used to flag when team members might be feeling stressed and help create solutions that recapture in office creativity. companies that can do this will be able to work more efficiently and productively and stand head and shoulders above the rest. ai has been a vital lifeline for talent teams in the pandemic but its use won t end with the return to work. it s demonstrated how businesses can transform their working practices to be fairer more effective and boost their bottom line. ai is the future of resourcing and the companies that recognize this will be able to survive and grow beyond the pandemic. the ones that don t will simply be left """
social,while observing world elder abuse awareness day june 15 state agencies explain new task force s role in protecting senior citizens. as we observe world elder abuse awareness day we are reminded how important it is to protect one of our most vulnerable populations said georgia bureau of investigation gbi director vic reynolds. every day the gbi is committed to investigating not only physical abuse but also financial abuse exploitation of elderly and at risk adults. in february the gbi created a new task force called the crimes against disabled adults and elderly cade task force in cooperation with the department of human services dhs division of aging services das and the forensic special initiatives unit fsiu . fsiu s designated staff handles most of the education outreach and training programs found in georgia for primary and secondary responders including law enforcement prosecutors judges ems employees of financial institutions regulatory protective social victim service agencies key healthcare providers coroners medical examiners and other professions who respond to the abuse neglect and exploitation of at risk adults. combining the efforts of fsiu with the gbi toward the prevention detection and protection of at risk adults from abuse neglect and exploitation creates more efficient and effective state government operations and will better ensure the gaps in such operations are identified and addressed. this collaborative effort between fsiu and the gbi has shown that through these efforts the number of perpetrators arrested each year continues to increase. the work of the task force is more effective when supporting state and local agencies involved in the recognition of and response to elder abuse in addition to multidisciplinary teams comprised of public safety regulatory protective social medical mental health disability and victim service agencies. dhs commissioner robyn a. crittenden said the work of our forensic special initiatives unit is so crucial to educating first responders and other social service professionals on how to identify abuse neglect and exploitation cases so we can effectively seek justice for the victims of these crimes and hold perpetrators responsible for their actions. this work requires involvement with so many other agencies and entities and the cade task force will help us bring all of those players to the same table so we can continue to provide support to identify and prevent crimes against older and disabled adults in our community crittenden said. the cade task force s support involves developing and conducting training providing technical and case assistance and advancing policy through the identification of gaps in services. this support enhances the ability of agencies across the state to partner with the public who are the eyes and ears in the community. victims need to be empowered to report what has happened to them and not be afraid or embarrassed. report any suspicion of abuse neglect or exploitation to the local police and adult protective services aps at 1 866 55aging 866 552 4464 option 3 if the victim lives in a private residence. if the victim lives in a long term care facility contact the local police and the healthcare facility regulation division with the department of community health at 800 878 6442.
