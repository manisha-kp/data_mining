bear to save her dogs who were barking at the cubs of the bear. in the video a bear and two cubs walked along a brick wall in hailey s backyard. after seeing the bear three of her dogs started barking at the bear family. alien like creature walking on road at night video goes viral . at the time of the incident hailey s family was gardening at the other end of the yard. the cctv footage shows the

bioethanol. when corn stover contains moisture above certain levels it can clog conveyers and chutes during processing leading to operational problems and process stoppages. to eliminate moisture related stoppages at biorefineries scientists at los alamos national laboratory los alamos collaborated with bulk solids handling engineers at jenike johanson tyngsboro to develop smart transfer chutes. the biomass handling chutes are outfitted with acoustic moisture sensors for continuous realtime monitoring of corn stover moisture levels. the acoustic moisture sensors work by directing soundwaves through the corn stover as it is being processed. if moisture contents exceed those that are known to cause stoppages it sends a signal to a computer which engages a track change on the conveyor belt redirecting it to be further dried. the system improves the operational efficiency of biomass processing and helps improve the cost effectiveness of biofuels the researchers say. improve

first time a surfactant made using captured carbon emissions will come to market in a cleaning product. first lanzatech uses biotechnology to capture waste industrial emissions at its beijing shougang

from the graduate school of engineering at tohoku university japan has developed an ion selective smart porous membrane that can respond to external stimuli for controlling permeation. the technology has potential applications in molecular separation and sensing applications. nanostructure properties such as pore size thickness and film density affect molecular selectivity and molecular permeability. surface properties also have a significant impact on molecular selectivity. therefore it is important to be able to control both the 3 d nanostructures and surface properties of ultrathin porous films. in our study we succeeded in developing responsive porous sio2 thin films with an extremely thin film thickness of 8 nm with a uniformly covered surface in a ph responsive silane coupling agent says yuya ishizaki a co author of the study published in langmuir. the responsive porous thin film can adjust the surface charge depending on the ph change in the solution resulting in selective ion permeation. to prepare the porous films with a controlled structure to nanometer scale accuracy the research group focused on polymer thin films containing silsesquioxanes which have unique cage structures. the polymer films were fabricated using the langmuir blodgett technique chosen because it provides molecular scale controllability in the film thickness. langmuir blodgett polymer nanosheets also make it possible to fabricate porous sio2 thin films with controlled nanostructures by simple ultraviolet uv light irradiation under ambient conditions. winterthur
